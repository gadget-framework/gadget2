Introduction to Gadget {#chap-intro}
======================

Gadget is the **G**lobally applicable **A**rea **D**isaggregated
**G**eneral **E**cosystem **T**oolbox. Gadget is a flexible and powerful
software tool that has been developed to model marine ecosystems,
including both the impact of the interactions between species and the
impact of fisheries harvesting the species. Gadget simulates these
processes in a biologically realistic manner, and uses a framework to
test the development of the modelled ecosystem in a statistically
rigorous manner. Gadget has successfully been used to investigate the
population dynamics of stock complexes in Icelandic waters, the Barents
Sea, the North Sea and the Irish and Celtic Seas.

What is Gadget? {#sec-whatisgadget}
---------------

Gadget can run complicated statistical models which take many features
of the ecosystem into account. Gadget works by running an internal
forward projection model based on many parameters describing the
ecosystem, and then comparing the output from this model to observed
measurements to get a likelihood score. The model ecosystem parameters
can then be adjusted, and the model re-run, until an optimum is found,
which corresponds to the model with the lowest likelihood score. This
iterative, computationally intensive process is handled within Gadget,
using a robust minimisation algorithm. The Gadget software framework
consists of three parts:

-   a parametric model to **simulate** the ecosystem

-   statistical functions to **compare** the model output to data

-   search algorithms to **optimise** the model parameters

Gadget allows the user to include a number of features of the ecosystem
into the model: One or more species, each of which may be split into
multiple components; multiple areas with migration between areas;
predation between and within species; growth; maturation; reproduction
and recruitment; multiple commercial and survey fleets taking catches
from the populations.


Like any large piece of code, Gadget is based on previous ideas by
several authors. Conceptually the modelling framework extends earlier
multi species programming work such as MSVPA and MULTSPEC into a more
generic statistical framework. Alternatively, Gadget is a conceptual
extension of the Stock Synthesis statistical assessment single-species
framework into a multi species setting.


The initial BORMICON code was developed as part of a multi species
programme implemented at the Marine Research Institute in Reykjavik,
Iceland, starting in 1992 with Ólafur K Pálsson as project coordinator
and Gunnar Stefánsson coordinating the modelling work. Subsequently the
code became the basis for Fleksibest at the Institute of Marine Research
in Bergen, Norway. Further development work in 1999-2003 was partly
funded by EU grant QLK5-CT1999-01609 ("Development of Structurally
Detailed Statistically Testable Models of Marine Populations").
Development work for 2004-2006 was partly funded by EU grant 502482
("Critical Interactions Between Species and their Implications for a
Precautionary Fisheries Management in a Variable Environment - a
Modelling Approach"). Developement work for 2010-2012 was partly funded
by EU project "Defineit" under the MariFish ERA-NET (grant
ERAC-CT-2006-025989)


The Gadget code is derived from the original BORMICON code of Halldór
Narfi Stefánsson, Höskuldur Björnsson and Hersir Sigurgeirsson.
Subsequent contributions include program additions by Morten Nygaard
Åsnes and Kristin Frøysa to include the Fleksibest model. The ability to
run in parallel across a network of computers using PVM was implemented
primarily by Auðbjörg Jakobsdóttir with input from several other people,
including Jón Guðmundsson who worked on a variant based on Condor.
Several mathematical additions and changes to allow for parallel
minimisation on a network were implemented by Þórdís Linda Þórarinsdóttir
and Kristjana Ýr Jónsdóttir.


More recent changes include the work to use information from tagging
experiments, which was implemented primarily by Sigurður Hannesson. The
work on multivariate distributions was implemented by Bjarki Þór
Elvarsson. Recent additions including major code cleanups, modifications
to the input formats and debugging operations have been led by James
Begley, who is the current maintainer of the code and coordinator of all
programming efforts.

Getting Gadget {#sec-gettinggadget}
--------------

Gadget is distributed via GitHub and can be obtained at:

> http://github.com/Hafro/gadget2

That page will have instructions for how to install the most recent
version of Gadget. Follow the instructions there to install 

Gadget is a program that runs on a Unix computing platform, and is
regularly tested on machines running versions of Linux, Mac OSX and
Windows. It should also run on other versions of Unix, but this may
require modifications to the makefile in order to do so. Gadget is
distributed as a set of source code files, which need to be compiled
into an executable program before it can be run. Follow the instructions
on the link above to fetch and compile the Gadget sources.

Running Gadget {#sec-runninggadget}
--------------

Gadget is a command line program that runs on a Linux computing
platform. To start Gadget, simply type the following at a standard Linux
prompt:

    gadget <options>

where $<$options$>$ are a combination of the starting switches described
in the next section. Note that this assumes that the Gadget executable
has been placed in a directory that is included in the \$PATH, which
might not be the case for some Linux distributions. If this is the case,
Gadget should be started by including the path to the Gadget executable,
for example by typing if the Gadget executable is in the current
directory.

Gadget is not an interactive program, so once it has started there is no
need for any further input from the user. However, if Gadget was started
incorrectly (for example, using the wrong input files) then Gadget can
be stopped by pressing $<$CTRL$><$C$>$, which will interrupt the
calculations, displaying a menu from which it is possible to either
store the current calculations to a text file, or to exit (by pressing
$<$Q$>$).

When Gadget starts, it will look for a file called "main", which
contains a list of all the other data files required. Gadget will search
for this file in the following 2 locations:

1.  the directory specified by the Linux environment variable called
    "GADGET\_WORKING\_DIR", optionally taking data from the directory
    specified by the Linux environment variable called
    "GADGET\_DATA\_DIR"

2.  the current directory (ie. from where Gadget has been started) if
    these environment variables have not been set (note that this is the
    default location)

When Gadget is reading in the input data files, these files will be
checked to ensure that they are in the correct format, and if there is
an error in the format Gadget will print an error message and stop. Note
that when Gadget is checking the format of a data file containing a
number of columns (eg. the "area" file) it will only check the first
data line in the file (so, for the case of the "area" file it will check
that there are 4 entries on the first row and then assume that all the
other rows also have 4 entries). Hopefully, there should be enough
information in these error messages to lead the user to the input file
that is causing the error.

If all else fails, and the error messages do not lead the user to the
source of the error, then there is an email address set up for any
difficulties or questions that may arise, or reporting any bugs that get
found. In addition to sorting out any problems that the user may be
getting, we can also try to help with interpreting the output. This
email address is gadgethelp\@hafro.is

Sending an email to this address should get a response within a couple
of working days. This email address can also be used to give us any
feedback on the usefulness (or otherwise) of Gadget, so let us know what
you think!

Starting Switches {#sec-starting}
-----------------

The following is a list of the command line switches that Gadget will
recognise, together with a brief description of what the switch means to
the running of the Gadget model.

    gadget -s

Starting Gadget with the -s switch will start a simulation run, where a
single run of the model will take place. This option is useful since it
will give the model output (see Print Files,
chapter \@ref(chap-print)),
and it is used when running large Gadget models, using the paramin
parallel processing optimiser to find the optimum.

    gadget -l

Starting Gadget with the -l switch will start a optimising run, where
the overall likelihood score will be reduced to an optimum, depending on
the optimising information given (see the -opt switch).

    gadget -n

Starting Gadget with the -n switch will start a network run, used in
conjunction with the paramin optimiser to find an optimal solution for
large models.

    gadget -v
    gadget --version

Starting Gadget with the -v (or \--version) switch will display the
version of Gadget that is being run.

    gadget -h
    gadget --help

Starting Gadget with the -h (or \--help) switch will display a help
screen, giving information about the various starting switches that can
be used.

    gadget -i <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -i switch will give Gadget an inputfile file
from which the initial values and bounds of any variables can be read
(see Parameter Files, chapter \@ref(chap-param), for more information on the format of this
file).

    gadget -opt <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -opt switch will give Gadget an optimisation
input file, from which the information about the optimisation routines
will be read. This will specify the type of optimisation to perform, and
also parameters for that optimisation routine (see Optimisation Files,
chapter \@ref(chap-optim),
for more information on the format of this file).

    gadget -main <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -main switch will specify a filename for the
main Gadget model input file, which contains links to all the other data
files that are to be used by Gadget (see Main File,
section \@ref(sec-mainfile), for more information on the format of this
file). If Gadget is started without the -main switch, Gadget will use
the default filename "main" as the name for the main file.

    gadget -p <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -p switch specifies the file that Gadget will
use to print the final values and bounds of the variables, in the same
format as for the inputfile. This file can then be used as the starting
point for a subsequent Gadget run, if required. This file will always be
generated, and if Gadget is started without the -p switch the default
filename is "params.out" which will be created in the current directory
(see Output Files, chapter \@ref(chap-output), for more information on the format of this
file).

    gadget -o <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -o switch specifies the file that Gadget will
use to print the score from the likelihood calculations. This file will
give details on the parameters that have been used, the likelihood
components that have been used, and the values for these parameters and
likelihood components. This can be a large file if Gadget is performing
an optimising run (see Output Files,
chapter \@ref(chap-output), for more information on the format of this
file).

    gadget -print <number>

Starting Gadget with the -print switch will specify the frequency with
which information is written to the likelihood output file (specified
with the -o switch). The default value for this is 1, meaning that the
likelihood information is written for every iteration.

    gadget -precision <number>

Starting Gadget with the -precision switch will specify the number of
digits to be used when printing the output from the likelihood
calculations to files specified with the -o switch.

    gadget -log <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -log switch will specify a file to which Gadget
will write logging messages to keep a record of internal Gadget actions.
This can be a large file if Gadget is performing an optimising run (see
Log Output, section \@ref(sec-logoutput), for more information on the format of this
file).

    gadget -loglevel <number>

Starting Gadget with the -loglevel switch will specify the level of
detail that is to be used by Gadget when logging messages (both to the
screen and to a log file if one has been specified with the -log
switch). If Gadget is started without the -loglevel switch then the
default is for warning messages and error messages to be shown during a
simulation run (when Gadget is started with the -s switch) and only
error messages are shown during an optimising run (when Gadget is
started with the -l switch).

    gadget -seed <number>

Starting Gadget with the -seed switch will specify the value that is
used to initialise the random number generator used within Gadget (see
Repeatability, section \@ref(sec-repeat) for more information on the use of the random
number generator within Gadget runs).

    gadget -m <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -m switch will specify a file from which Gadget
can read the other command line options. This file should contain a
simple list of the switches and their values, as they would be entered
from the command line.

    gadget -printinitial <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -printinitial switch will specify a file to
which Gadget will write all internal information for the model at the
start of the run (ie. the stock populations, likelihood calculations and
other information from before the first timestep). This file will be
large for moderately complicated models, and it is of most use for
debugging purposes.

    gadget -printfinal <filename>

Starting Gadget with the -printfinal switch will specify a file to which
Gadget will write all internal information for the model at the end of
the run (ie. the stock populations, likelihood calculations and other
information from after the last timestep). This file will be large for
moderately complicated models, and it is of most use for debugging
purposes.

    gadget -maxratio <ratio>

Starting Gadget with the -maxratio switch will specify the maximum ratio
of prey that is allowed to be "consumed" on any one timestep. This
consumption includes both the consumption by other stocks and the catch
by any fleets. The default value is 0.95, which ensures that no more
than 95% of the available stock biomass is consumed on a single
timestep.


Most of these switches can be combined to specify more information about
the Gadget run that will be performed. For instance:

    gadget -l -i inputfile.txt -o likelihood.txt -opt optinfo.txt -print 10

will start Gadget for a likelihood run, taking the initial values and
information about the parameters from the file inputfile.txt, with the
optimisation being done in accordance with the information in
optinfo.txt, and printing likelihood information (every 10 iterations)
to the file likelihood.txt.


Note that it is not possible to do both a simulation run and a
likelihood run at the same time, and starting Gadget with both the -l
and -s switches will result in a warning, after which Gadget will
perform a simulation run, with the -l switch being ignored.

Input Files {#chap-input}
===========

All the input files for Gadget are plain ASCII text files, so they can
be viewed in any plain-text text editor. Any whitespace or blank lines
in the data files are ignored, so the layout of the files can be
adjusted into a easily viewable form to check the content of the files.
The case of any text in an input file is ignored by Gadget, so for
example, "Stock" and "stock" would be interpreted by Gadget as being the
same.


Unless stated otherwise, all the input and output files use the
following measurement units:

-   length - all measurements are in centimetres

-   weight - all measurements are in kilogrammes

-   age - all measurements are in years

Gadget is a program that runs on a Linux computing platform, so the
input data files must use a Linux style end-of-line character
($<$linefeed$>$) and not a Windows style end-of-line character
($<$carriage return$><$linefeed$>$). All the lines of the input files
containing data should end with an end-of-line character.

Comments in Input Files {#sec-comments}
-----------------------

Any of the input files used by Gadget can contain comments that are not
used by Gadget. The start of the comment is denoted by a semi-colon ";".
Once Gadget has read as far as the semi-colon, the rest of the line will
be ignored.

What Does The \# Mean? {#sec-whatdoeshash}
----------------------

When Gadget is performing an optimising run, a number of the parameters
can be adjusted to try to find a better fit between the modelled output
and the data. The parameters that are to be adjusted are termed
"switches" and are marked in the input files by the '\#' character.
There are two valid formats for switches in the data file - either
directly, or as part of a function.

### Switches

The format for the switches is given by:

    <numerical part>#<name>

where the $<$numerical part$>$ consists of the (optional) initial value
for the switch, and the $<$name$>$ is a alpha-numerical text string used
to identify the switch in the parameter file. Note that there is no
whitespace either before or after the '\#' character. Also note that the
name of the switch cannot contain a hyphen, since this will be
interpreted by Gadget as the mathematical subtraction symbol.


Any initial value specified in the data files will be overwritten by the
initial value given in the parameter file (see
chapter \@ref(chap-param).
If the initial value is not given, then a value of 1 with be assumed by
Gadget. A switch can appear in more than one place in the data files,
but needs to be defined with the same initial value each time.


Examples of valid switches in the data files can include:

1.  defining a simple switch (called "age2") without an initial value

        #age2

2.  defining a switch with an initial value

        10#age2

### Functions

The format for the functions is given by:

    (<function> <parameters>)

where the $<$function$>$ defines the name of the function, and the
$<$parameters$>$ is a vectors of the parameters to be used - either
numbers or the names of switches denoted by the '\#' character. Note
that the function is contained within (round brackets). Valid function
names include the 4 mathematical operators ('\*', '+', '-' and '/'),
trigonometric functions ('sin' and 'cos', with the argument in radians),
logarithmic functions ('log', 'log10' and 'exp'), square root ('sqrt')
and a function to generate a random number between 0 and 1 ('rand').


Examples of valid functions for the switches in the data files can
include:

1.  defining a function based on a switch

        (* 10 #age2)

    note that in this case, Gadget will use 10 times the value of
    parameter "age2".

2.  defining a function based on more than one switch

        (* #area1 #age2)

    note that in this case, Gadget will use the value of parameter
    "area1" multiplied by the value of parameter "age2".

3.  nesting functions

        (log (+ #area1 #age2))

    note that in this case, Gadget will use the value of the natural
    logarithm of parameter "area1" plus parameter "age2".

Model Files {#chap-model}
===========

Gadget requires a number of data files to define a Gadget model. The
number of data files required depends on the complexity of the Gadget
model, and there is no limit on the number, or name, of these data
files. The main input file gives links to all the other data files
required, and must be specified with the "-main $<$filename$>$" command
line option, or be called "main".

Main File {#sec-mainfile}
---------

The main Gadget input file is usually called "main", unless it is
specified with the "-main $<$filename$>$" command line option. This file
only contains links to other files which will make up the Gadget model.
The format for this file is:

    <typeoffile>        <filename>

where $<$typeoffile$>$ is a keyword to tell Gadget what sort of
information the file will contain, and the name of the file is given by
$<$filename$>$, relative to the directory in which the main file
resides. Where zero or more files of a certain type could be used, the
main file is divided into sections that are separated by a keyword in
[square brackets]. The format for the main file is shown below:

    timefile            <name of the time file>
    areafile            <name of the area file>
    printfiles          <names of the print files>
    [stock]
    stockfiles          <names of the stock files>
    [tagging]
    tagfiles            <names of the tag files>
    [otherfood]
    otherfoodfiles      <names of the otherfood files>
    [fleet]
    fleetfiles          <names of the fleet files>
    [likelihood]
    likelihoodfiles     <names of the likelihood files>

The printfile element of the main file is optional, and can be commented
out if no model output is required. It should be noted that the keyword
"printfiles" must be present, so to comment out the printfile section, a
semi colon should be placed before the name of the printfile, as shown
in the line below:

    printfiles ; <filename> commented out so no printing will take place

Time File {#sec-timefile}
---------

This specifies the start and end times for the model run, and the number
of timesteps per year. Note that the model can run into the future, and
that datasets covering only part of the overall run can be used. Gadget
splits each year up into a number of time steps, but these time steps
need not all be the same length.


The format for this file is a list of the first year and timestep, and
the last year and timestep, and how each year is to be divided into
timesteps. This is done by specifying first the number of timesteps in a
year, and then the length of each timestep (in months), and Gadget will
check that the number of timesteps in a year sums up to 12. This is
shown below:

    firstyear       <first year>
    firststep       <first step>
    lastyear        <last year>
    laststep        <last step>
    notimesteps     <how the year is split up>

Examples for how the year can be split up include:

1.  4 equal timesteps, splitting the year into quarters

        notimesteps     4 3 3 3 3

2.  12 equal timesteps, splitting the year into months

        notimesteps     12 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

3.  6 unequal timesteps, splitting the year into the following periods,
    $<$January - February$>$, $<$March$>$, $<$April - June$>$, $<$July -
    September$>$, $<$October$>$ and $<$November - December$>$

        notimesteps     6 2 1 3 3 1 2

Area File {#sec-areafile}
---------

This file specifies which areas the model will be run on, and gives a
time dependent temperature for each area. Note that although the
temperature data must be provided it need not actually be used,
depending on the growth and feeding options chosen for the stock file.


The format for this file is a list of the areas that are to be used (by
specifying a numeric identifier for each area), followed by the size of
each area (in square kilometres) and then a listing of the temperature
for each timestep and area combination. An example of this format is
given below:

    areas   <vector of area identifiers>
    size    <vector of sizes>
    temperature
    <year>  <step>  <area>  <temperature>

Other Input Data Files {#sec-otherinputfile}
----------------------

There are four other types of input that are important since they are
used in other data files to denote a grouping of data. These are
Aggregation files, which are files used to gather data into convenient
groups, TimeVariable files, which are files used to denote variables
that can vary over time, StockVariable files, which are files used to
denote vairables that can vary with population, and ActionAtTime, which
is used to define the timesteps that an action takes place within a data
file.

### Aggregation Files

Aggregation files are important since they are used to group the data in
convenient groups. They consist of a text label (used to identify the
group in the data) followed by a list of the data that the label
represents. This data will then be read in from an associated data file.
There are aggregation files to group areas, ages, lengths or preys
together. Aggregation files can contain comments and blank lines, to
make the format easier to view in a text editor.

#### Area Aggregation {#subsec-areaagg}

Area aggregation files contain one or more identifying labels and then a
list of one or more areas that the label refers to. The format for this
is:

    <label>      <areas>

An example of this is:

    north        1  2  6
    south        3  4  5  7

This example shows that for the associated data file, the label "north"
will be interpreted as applying to areas 1, 2 and 6 and the label
"south" will be interpreted as applying to areas 3, 4, 5 and 7.

#### Age Aggregation {#subsec-ageagg}

Age aggregation files contain one or more identifying labels and then a
list of one or more ages that the label refers to. The format for this
is:

    <label>      <ages>

An example of this is:

    young        1  2  3  4
    old          5  6  7

This example shows that for the associated data file, the label "young"
will be interpreted as applying to ages 1 - 4 and the label "old" will
be interpreted as applying to ages 5 to 7.

#### Length Aggregation {#subsec-lenagg}

Length aggregation files contain one or more identifying labels and then
the minimum and maximum length that the label refers to. The format for
this is:

    <label>      <minimum>  <maximum>

When more than one length group label is defined, then the labels should
be ordered so that the smallest length group is first in the file. The
data is checked, so that the maximum length associated with label
$<$i$>$ is the same as the minimum length for label $<$i+1$>$. An
example of this is:

    small        5   25
    medium       25  55
    large        55  80

This example shows that for the associated data file, the label "small"
will be interpreted as applying to lengths 5-25cm, the label "medium"
will be interpreted as applying to the lengths 25-55cm and the label
"large" will be interpreted as applying to lengths 55-80cm.

#### Prey Aggregation {#subsec-preyagg}

Prey aggregation files contain one or more identifying labels, and then
the names of the preys, the minimum and maximum lengths for the preys
and the digestion coefficients for the consumption of the preys. The
format for this is:

    <label>
    <prey names>
    lengths                  <minimum>  <maximum>
    digestioncoefficients    d0  d1  d2

The digestion coefficients define a multiplier used when calculating the
consumption of the prey. This multiplier is length dependant, and is
calculated according to the digestion equation given below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:digestion)
D = d_{0} + d_{1}l^{d_{2}}\end{equation}


An example of a prey aggregation file is:

    ; for the first prey
    smallcapelin
    immature.capelin
    lengths                  5  10
    digestioncoefficients    1  0  0
    ;
    ; for the second prey
    mediumcapelin
    immature.capelin mature.capelin
    lengths                  10 15
    digestioncoefficients    1  0  0
    ;
    ; for the third prey
    largecapelin
    mature.capelin
    lengths                  15 20
    digestioncoefficients    1  0  0

This example shows that for the associated data file, the label
"smallcapelin" will be interpreted as applying to immature capelin (a
stock called immature.capelin) of lengths 5-10cm, the label
"mediumcapelin" will be interpreted as applying to immature and mature
capelin (stocks immature.capelin and mature.capelin) of lengths 10-15cm,
and the label "largecapelin" will be interpreted as applying to mature
capelin (a stock called mature.capelin) of lengths 15-20cm.

### TimeVariable Files {#subsec-timevar}

TimeVariable files are used in place of a single variable in the input
files, to define variables in the Gadget model that can vary over time.
They are used by specifying the name of the TimeVariable file in place
of the value or parameter in the input file. TimeVariable files can
contain comments and blank lines, to make the format easier to view in a
text editor.


TimeVariable files consist of a one word description of the data,
followed by an optional multipler value and then the keyword "timedata",
and then a list of the timesteps when the value of TimeVariable changes,
along with the new value for the TimeVariable. The values can either be
numerical values or a parameter to be optimised. The first timestep in
the TimeVariable file must correspond to the first timestep in the
model. The basic format for this file is shown below:

    <description>          ; one word description of the data
    multipler              <optional multipler> ; default value 1
    timedata
    <year>  <step>  <value>

An example of a TimeVariable file is:

    annualgrowth
    timedata
    ; year  step  value
    1995    1     #grow1995
    1996    1     #grow1996
    1997    1     #grow1997
    1998    1     #grow1998
    1999    1     #grow1999
    2000    1     #grow2000

This example shows that the value of parameter "grow1995" is to be used
for growth in 1995, "grow1996" is to be used in 1996 and so on through
to "grow2000" which is to be used from 2000 through to the end of the
simulation. Note that this example assumes that the first timestep of
the simulation is the first timestep in 1995.

### StockVariable Files {#subsec-stockvar}

StockVariable files are used in place of a single variable in the input
files, in a similar manner to the TimeVariable files, to define
variables in the Gadget model that can vary due to stock populations
changes. They are used by specifying the name of the StockVariable file
in place of the value or parameter in the input file. StockVariable
files can contain comments and blank lines, to make the format easier to
view in a text editor.


StockVariable files consist of a one word description of the data,
followed by an optional multipler value and then the keyword
"stockdata", and then a list of the stocks to use when caluclating the
value of the StockVariable:

    <description>          ; one word description of the data
    multipler              <optional multipler> ; default value 1
    stockdata
    biomass                <0 or 1> ; default value 1
    <vector of stock names>

The optional flag $<$biomass$>$ is used to specify whether the biomass
or the number of the stock population is used when calcualting the value
of the StockVariable. If this is set to 0, then the StockVariable value
will be based on the available number of the stock(s). If this line is
not specified, then a biomass value of 1 is assumed and the
StockVariable value will be based on the available population numbers
for the stock(s).


An example of a StockVariable file is:

    capelinconsumption
    multipler     (* #param1 #param2)
    stockdata
    immature.capelin mature.capelin

This example shows that the value of the StockVariable is to be
calculated as the value of "param1" times the value of "param2" times
the total biomass of the stocks "immature.capelin" plus
"mature.capelin".

### ActionAtTime {#subsec-aat}

ActionAtTime is a simple list of timesteps within a data file that
define when a specified action (for example printing) will take place.
The format for this is:

    <year>  <step>

where year and step are either a valid timestep or the keyword "all".
These can be grouped together to specify a more complex time period.


Examples of valid ActionAtTime entries in the data files include:

1.  the action taking place on the first timestep of 2002

        2002    1

2.  the action taking place on all timesteps of 2000

        2000    all

3.  the action taking place on the second timestep of each year

        all     2

4.  the action taking place on all timesteps of each year

        all     all

5.  the action taking place on the first and second timesteps of each
    year

        all     1
        all     2

Stock Files {#chap-stock}
===========

The stock files contain all the information that Gadget requires for
each stock in the model. To define the stock files in the Gadget model,
the following lines are required in the "main" Gadget file:

    [stock]
    stockfiles             <names of the stock files>

The "main" file needs to list the files that define the stocks to be
used in the model. Each stock requires a separate stock file. The
information for the stocks are very detailed, and so these stock files
are quite large and can be complicated to look at. The basic format for
this file is:

    stockname              <name of the stock>
    livesonareas           <areas that the stock lives on>
    minage                 <minimum age for the stock>
    maxage                 <maximum age for the stock>
    minlength              <minimum length for the stock>
    maxlength              <maximum length for the stock>
    dl                     <step size for the length groups>
    refweightfile          <see Reference Weight>
    growthandeatlengths    <see Growth and Eat Lengths>
    doesgrow               <see Growth>
    naturalmortality       <see Natural Mortality>
    iseaten                <see Stock Prey>
    doeseat                <see Stock Predator>
    initialconditions      <see Initial Conditions>
    doesmigrate            <see Migration>
    doesmature             <see Maturation>
    doesmove               <see Movement>
    doesrenew              <see Renewal>
    doesspawn              <see Spawning>
    doesstray              <see Straying>

The first seven lines of this file give the basic details of the stock,
and are fairly self explanatory. It should be noted that the oldest age
group and the longest length group are interpreted in Gadget as plus
groups for the stock. The remaining lines give more detail about the
stock, and are covered in the sub sections below.

Reference Weight {#sec-stockrefweight}
----------------

The reference weight section lists the weight of the stock for various
length groups. This is the reference weight that can be used in the
initial conditions to set up the stock, and can also be used by the
growth functions when calculating the increase in length of the stock
due to the growth. In the stock file, the format for the reference
weight is given by:

    refweightfile          <name of the reference weight file>

The format of the reference weight file is simply a two column list of
the length and the corresponding weight for the stock. This file is
ordered so that the smallest length group is given first, up to the
longest length group which is given last. The format for this file is
shown below:

    <length>  <weight>

When this data is read into Gadget it is aggregated so that the weight
is calculated for each length group defined in the stock file.

Growth and Eat Lengths {#sec-stockgrowthlength}
----------------------

The calculations for the growth and consumption parts of the Gadget
model can be done on a coarser scale than that defined in the stock
file. The growth and eat lengths section of the stock file gives the
name of a length aggregation file that defines this length grouping. In
the stock file, the format for the growth and eat lengths is:

    growthandeatlengths    <name of the length aggregation file>

Growth {#sec-stockgrowth}
------

The growth section of the stock file determines if, and how, the stock
will grow in the Gadget model. The format for the first part of the
growth section is given below:

    doesgrow               <0 or 1> ; 0 for no growth, 1 for growth

If there is no growth, then the following sections don't apply, and the
next section of the input file is the natural mortality, given in
section \@ref(sec-stocknatmort) below. If the stock does grow, there are
various different functions that determine the mean growth of the stock,
so there are a number of different formats that the growth data can
take. Once the mean growth has been calculated, the growth then needs to
be statistically distributed to give the overall growth of the stock.
Thus, after the growth function data has been read in, there is then
data for the growth implementation. The full format for the growth of
the stock is therefore given by:

    doesgrow               1
    growthfunction         <growth function>
    <format for the growth function data>
    <format for the growth implementation>

The $<$growth function$>$ defines what growth function is to be used to
calculate the growth of the stock. Currently, there are 7 growth
functions defined, so valid function names are:



* `multspec` - use the MULTSPEC growth function 
* `weightvb` - use the WeightVB growth function 
* `weightjones` - use the WeightJones growth function
* `weightvbexpanded` - use the WeightVBExpanded growth function 
* `lengthvb` - use the LengthVB growth function 
* `lengthpower` - use the LengthPower growth function 
* `lengthvbsimple` - use the LengthVBSimple growth function

### MULTSPEC Growth Function {#subsec-growth1}

This growth function is a simplified "MULTSPEC" growth equation, with
the increase in length for each length group of the stock given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth1l), and the corresponding increase in weight of
the stock given by equation \@ref(eq:growth1w) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth1l)
\Delta L_{i} = \Delta t p_{0} {L_{i}}^{p_{1}} \psi (p_{2} T + p_{3})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth1w)
\Delta W_{i} = \Delta t p_{4} {W_{i}}^{p_{5}} (\psi - p_{6}) (p_{7} T + p_{8})\end{equation}

where:
$<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year
$<$ T $>$ is the temperature
$<\psi>$ is the feeding level (see section \@ref(sec-consumption)


There are 4 parameters in the length equation, and 5 in the weight
equation, giving a total of 9 parameters to be declared to define this
growth function. This is given in the main stock file by declaring a
single vector with 9 components, consisting of the 4 length parameters
followed by the 5 weight parameters. This is shown below:

    growthparameters       <growth parameters vector>

### WeightVB Growth Function {#subsec-growth3}

This growth function is a form of the Von Bertalanffy growth equation,
extended to introduce the concept of starvation to the growth function.
The increase in the weight for each length group the stock is given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth3w), and the corresponding increase in the length
of the stock is given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth3lc) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth3w)
\Delta W_{i} = \Delta t q_{0} e^{q_{1} T} \left( \left( \frac{W_{i}}{q_{2}} \right)^{q_{4}} - \left( \frac{W_{i}}{q_{3}} \right)^{q_{5}} \right)\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth3la)
r = \frac{W - \left( p_{0} + p_{8} \left( p_{1} + p_{2}p_{8} \right) \right) W_{ref}}{W}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth3lb)
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \textrm{if $p_{3} + p_{4}x \leq 0$} \\
p_{5} & \textrm{if $p_{3} + p_{4}x \geq p_{5}$} \\
p_{3} + p_{4}x & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth3lc)
\Delta L_{i} = \frac{\Delta W_{i}} {p_{6} p_{7} l^{p_{7} - 1}} f(r)\end{equation}

where:
$<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year
$<$ T $>$ is the temperature
$<W_{ref}>$ is the reference weight


Comparing the weight to the reference weight (by using
equations\@ref(eq:growth3la) and
\@ref(eq:growth3lb) introduces the concept of starvation to the
Gadget model. When the weight of the population is less than a function
of the reference weight, there is no length increase (ensuring that the
growth only has an effect on the weight).


There are 6 parameters for the equation for increase of the weight, and
a further 9 parameters for the increase in length. These are declared in
2 vectors, as shown below:

    wgrowthparameters      <weight parameters vector>
    lgrowthparameters      <length parameters vector>

### WeightJones Growth Function {#subsec-growth4}

This growth function is a form of the Jones growth equation, extended to
introduce the concept of starvation to the growth function. The increase
in the weight for each length group the stock is given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth4w), and the corresponding increase in the length
of the stock is given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth4lc) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth4w)
\Delta W_{i} = \Delta t \left( \frac{C}{q_{0} W_{i}^{q_{1}}} - q_{2} W_{i}^{q_{3}} e^{(q_{4} T + q_{5})} \right)\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth4la)
r = \frac{W - \left( p_{0} + \psi \left( p_{1} + p_{2}\psi \right) \right) W_{ref}}{W}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth4lb)
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \textrm{if $p_{3} + p_{4}x \leq 0$} \\
p_{5} & \textrm{if $p_{3} + p_{4}x \geq p_{5}$} \\
p_{3} + p_{4}x & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth4lc)
\Delta L_{i} = \frac{\Delta W_{i}} {p_{6} p_{7} l^{p_{7} - 1}} f(r)\end{equation}

where:
$<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year
$<$ C $>$ is the consumption (see section \@ref(sec-consumption)
$<$ T $>$ is the temperature
$<\psi>$ is the feeding level (see section \@ref(sec-consumption)
$<W_{ref}>$ is the reference weight


There are 6 parameters for the equation for increase of the weight, and
a further 8 parameters for the increase in length. These are declared in
2 vectors, as shown below:

    wgrowthparameters      <weight parameters vector>
    lgrowthparameters      <length parameters vector>

### WeightVBExpanded Growth Function {#subsec-growth5}

This growth function is an expanded form of the Von Bertalanffy growth
equation, with additional information to allow for differing growth
depending on the year, timestep and area. The increase in the weight of
the stock is given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth5w) below, and the corresponding increase in the
length of the stock is identical to that for WeightVB growth function
(see section \@ref(subsec-growth3)) given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth3lc):

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth5w)
\Delta W_{i} = \Delta t Y_{y} S_{s} A_{a} q_{0} e^{q_{1}T} \left( \left( \frac{W_{i}}{q_{2}} \right)^{q_{4}} - \left( \frac{W_{i}}{q_{3}} \right)^{q_{5}} \right)
\end{equation}

where:
$<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year
$<$ T $>$ is the temperature
$<Y_{y}>$ is a multiplier for year y
$<S_{s}>$ is a multiplier for step s
$<A_{a}>$ is a multiplier for area a


There are 6 parameters for the equation for increase of the weight, and
a further 9 parameters for the increase in length and these are declared
in 2 vectors. Additionally there are vectors for the year, step and area
multipliers, as is shown below:

    wgrowthparameters      <weight parameters vector>
    lgrowthparameters      <length parameters vector>
    yeareffect             <year effect vector>
    stepeffect             <step effect vector>
    areaeffect             <area effect vector>

Note that the $<$year effect$>$ vector requires one entry for each year,
the $<$step effect$>$ vector requires one entry for each step and the
$<$area effect$>$ vector requires one entry for each area.

### LengthVB Growth Function {#subsec-growth6}

This growth function is a simplified form of the Von Bertalanffy growth
equation. The increase in the length for each length group the stock is
given by equation \@ref(eq:growth6), with the corresponding increase in the weight
of the stock read in from a data file:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth6)
\Delta L_{i} = \left( L_{\infty} - L_{i} \right) \left( 1 - e^{-\kappa \Delta t} \right)\end{equation}

where: $<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year


There are a total of 2 parameters for the equation for increase in
length. These are declared in a single vector, as shown below:

    growthparameters       <linf> <kappa>
    weightgrowthfile       <weight data file>

It is important to note that if the value of $L_{\infty}$ is less than
the mean length of a length group, then the length increase calculated
by equation \@ref(eq:growth6) would be negative for that length group, which
will result in Gadget printing a warning message. To avoid this, the
user should ensure that the value of $L_{\infty}$ is always greater than
the mean length of the largest length group.


The weight data file consists of a list of the year, timestep, area and
length group label, followed by the mean increase in weight for that
timestep/area/length combination. The length group label used must match
those specified in the growthandeatlengths length aggregation file. The
format of this file is shown below:

    <year>  <step>  <area>  <length group>  <number>

### LengthPower Growth Function {#subsec-growth7}

This growth function uses a simple power-based growth equation to
calculate the increase in length. The increase in the length for each
length group the stock is given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth7), with the corresponding increase in the weight
of the stock read in from a data file:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth7)
\Delta L_{i} = L_{i}^{q_{0}} e^{q_{1} \Delta t}\end{equation}

where: $<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year


There are a total of 2 parameters for the equation for increase in
length. These are declared in a single vector, as shown below:

    growthparameters       <growth parameters vector>
    weightgrowthfile       <weight data file>

The weight data file consists of a list of the year, timestep, area and
length group label, followed by the mean increase in weight for that
timestep/area/length combination. The length group label used must match
those specified in the growthandeatlengths length aggregation file. The
format of this file is shown below:

    <year>  <step>  <area>  <length group>  <number>

### LengthVBSimple Growth Function {#subsec-growth8}

This growth function is a simplified form of the Von Bertalanffy growth
equation. The increase in the length for each length group the stock is
given by equation \@ref(eq:growth8l), and the corresponding increase in the weight
of the stock is given by
equation \@ref(eq:growth8w) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth8l)
\Delta L_{i} = \left( L_{\infty} - L_{i} \right) \left( 1 - e^{-\kappa \Delta t} \right)\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:growth8w)
\Delta W_{i} = \alpha \left( \left( L_{i} + \Delta L_{i} \right) ^{\beta} - {L_{i}}^{\beta} \right)\end{equation}

where: $<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year


There are a total of 4 parameters for the equation for increase in
length and weight. These are declared in a single vector, as shown
below:

    growthparameters       <linf> <kappa> <alpha> <beta>

It is important to note that if the value of $L_{\infty}$ is less than
the mean length of a length group, then the length increase calculated
by equation \@ref(eq:growth8l) would be negative for that length group, which
will result in Gadget printing a warning message. To avoid this, the
user should ensure that the value of $L_{\infty}$ is always greater than
the mean length of the largest length group.

Growth Implementation {#sec-stockgrowthimplement}
---------------------

The growth functions described above calculate the mean growth for the
stock within the model. This must then be translated into a statistical
distribution of actual growths around that mean. Currently there is only
one statistical distribution implemented with Gadget, the beta-binomial,
which is described below.


Note that regardless of the results of the implementation function there
is a minimum width to the possible distribution implemented in Gadget -
where growth is allocated between two adjacent length categories. This
is a result of the discretisation within Gadget. To avoid this the user
should select a length category size small enough for some fish to grow
by at least 3 or 4 categories in one time step.

### Beta-Binomial

This method uses a statistical distribution to govern the implementation
of fish growth. The statistical distribution chosen is the
beta-binomial, an extension of the binomial distribution with the
flexibility to produce non-symmetrical distributions, which is defined
for integers, x = 0, ..., n as:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:betabin1)
{n \choose x} p^x (1 - p)^{n - x} = \frac{\Gamma(n + 1)}{\Gamma(x + 1)\Gamma(n - x + 1)} p^x (1 - p)^{n - x}\end{equation}

For more flexibility, this can be re-arranged by calculating the
parameter $<$p$>$ from a second beta-binomial distribution, leading to
equation \@ref(eq:betabin2) shown below, which is defined for 0 $\le$ p
$\le$ 1:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:betabin2)
f(p) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta)}p^{\alpha - 1}(1 - p)^{\beta - 1}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(\#eq:betabin3)
\alpha = \frac{\beta \Delta L}{n - \Delta L}\end{equation}

The distribution is governed by three parameters; the mean length growth
computed by the growth function scaled by dividing by the width of the
length groups ($<\Delta$L $>$), a fixed limit on the number of length
groups ($<$ n $>$), and a value for beta. This distribution was chosen
because it provides a high degree of flexibility resulting from changing
a single estimated parameter, beta. To define the distribution data
using a beta-binomial distribution the following data is required in the
main stock file:

    beta                   <beta>
    maxlengthgroupgrowth   <max length group growth>

The parameter $<$beta$>$ is the parameter that Gadget can estimate in
the optimisation routines, in order to tune the distribution to best fit
the data. High values of beta produce a narrow distribution, whilst
lower values produce a more dispersed distribution with a larger
right-hand tail. Note that very low values of beta (which lead to
$\alpha$ \< 1 in
equation \@ref(eq:betabin3)) can lead to unexpected results and should be
avoided.


The $<$max length group growth$>$ value is the maximum number of length
categories a fish is permitted to grow in a single timestep within the
model. This should be set to be several length groups larger than any
fish can be reasonably expected to grow in a time step, in order to
provide the beta-binomial distribution with sufficient flexibility to
produce a distribution around the mean.

Natural Mortality {#sec-stocknatmort}
-----------------

The natural mortality is a measure of how much of the stock will be
removed from the model due to additional natural causes that are not
modelled as part of other processes (for example predation). In Gadget,
this is simply modelled as the proportion of the stock that is removed
due to these additional causes (the residual mortality) from each age
group, on each timestep, as shown in
equation \@ref(eq:natmort) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:natmort)
N_{a} = e^{-m_{a} \Delta t}\end{equation}

where: $<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep, as a fraction of year.


The natural mortality parameters $<m_{a}>$ are specified in the stock
file as a vector, with one parameter per age group, as shown below:

    naturalmortality       <natural mortality vector>

Stock Prey {#sec-stockprey}
----------

The stock prey section of the stock file determines if, and how, the
stock will be treated as a prey in the Gadget model. The format for the
first part of the prey section of the main stock file is given below:

    iseaten                <0 or 1> ; 0 for not eaten, 1 for eaten

Note that the fleets are treated as a predator by Gadget, so for the
stock to be caught by the fleets, the stock needs to be declared as a
prey. If the stock is not eaten, then the following section doesn't
apply, and the next section of the input file is the stock predator,
given in section \@ref(sec-stockpredator) below. If the stock is eaten, then for
Gadget to treat it as a prey the length groups for that prey, and the
energy content of the prey, must be defined. The length groups need not
be to the same scale as for the stock as a whole. This is done by
listing a length aggregation file that is to be used, as well as the
energy content (in kilojoules per kilogram), as shown for the full
example below:

    iseaten                1
    preylengths            <length aggregation file>
    energycontent          <energy value>

Stock Predator {#sec-stockpredator}
--------------

The stock predator section of the stock file determines if, and how, the
stock will be treated as a predator in the Gadget model. The format for
the first part of the predator section is given below:

    doeseat                <0 or 1> ; 0 for not a predator, 1 for predator

If the stock is not a predator, then the following sections don't apply,
and the next section of the input file is the initial conditions, given
in section \@ref(sec-stockinitial) below. If the stock is a predator, then it
is necessary to specify information about the predation. This is done by
defining a suitability function, and then some prey preference,
consumption and feeding parameters. The full format for this is shown
below:

    doeseat                1
    suitability            <see Suitability>
    preference             <prey preference values>
    maxconsumption         <maximum consumption vector>
    halffeedingvalue       <half feeding value>

The $<$suitability$>$ defines the prey that the predator will consume,
and is discussed in the Suitability section below (see
section \@ref(sec-suitability). The $<$prey preference$>$ values,
$<$maximum consumption$>$ vector and $<$half feeding$>$ value parameters
define how the stock consumes any prey that is eaten, and are described
in the following section.

Consumption {#sec-consumption}
-----------

The consumption determines how much of a given prey is consumed by the
predator. This will result in the population of the prey being reduced,
and can also affect the growth of the predator, depending on the growth
function selected. The consumption of a prey is dependant on the length
of both the predator and the prey, and the amount of the prey available,
as a proportion of the total amount of food available. The consumption
of prey $p$ is given by
equation \@ref(eq:totalcons) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:totalcons)
C_{p}(l, L) = \frac{N_{L} M_{L} \psi_{L} F_{p}(l, L)}{\displaystyle \sum_{\it preys} F_{p}(l, L)}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:preycons)
F_{p}(l, L) =\Big( S_{p}(l, L) E_{p} N_{l} W_{l} \Big) ^{d_{p}}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:maxcons)
M_{L} = m_{0} \Delta t e^{(m_{1}T - m_{2}T^3)} L^{m_{3}}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:feedlevel)
\psi_{L} = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{\it preys} F_{p}(l, L)}{H \Delta t + \displaystyle \sum_{\it preys} F_{p}(l, L)}\end{equation}

where: $<$ L $>$ is the length of the predator $<$ l $>$ is the length
of the prey $<$ H $>$ is the half feeding value $<$ d $>$ is the
preference of the predator for the prey $<$ E $>$ is the energy content
of the prey (see section \@ref(sec-stockprey) $<$ N $>$ is the number of prey in the
length cell $<$ W $>$ is the mean weight of the prey in the length cell
$<$ S $>$ is the suitability function (see
section \@ref(sec-suitability)) $<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep
$<$ T $>$ is the temperature of the area that the feeding takes place on


In equation \@ref(eq:totalcons), the parameter $<$ F $>$ gives the amount of a
given prey that is consumed by the predator, given by multiplying the
biomass of the prey by the suitability (see
section \@ref(sec-suitability)), as shown in
equation \@ref(eq:preycons). The summation over preys is over all preys
that the predator consumes, including non-modelled prey, given as
"otherfood" in section \@ref(chap-other). The value of $<$ C $>$ can have an affect on
the growth of the predator when the growth function has been set to
"WeightJones".


In equation \@ref(eq:preycons), the parameter $<$ d $>$ gives the preference
of the predator for the prey, controlling the form of the functional
response that is used to model the predation. Setting this parameter to
1 will ensure that a Type II functional response is used (note that this
is always used when modelling the predation by the fleets, see
section \@ref(chap-fleet).
Any other value will mean that a Type III functional response is used.
The prey preference parameter is specified by listing the names of the
prey and the associated preference value, as shown in the example below:

    ...
    preference
    <name of prey 1>       <preference for prey 1>
    <name of prey 2>       <preference for prey 2>
    maxconsumption         <maximum consumption vector>
    ...

In equation \@ref(eq:maxcons), the parameter $<$ M $>$ gives the maximum
possible consumption for the predator on the current timestep. This is a
function of temperature and the length of the predator, using the 4
parameters specified by the $<$maximum consumption$>$ vector in the
input file. Note that the maximum consumption should be specified in
kilojoules per month.


In equation \@ref(eq:feedlevel), the parameter $<\psi>$ gives the "feeding
level" which denotes the fraction of the available food that the
predator is consuming. This is governed by the total amount of prey
available and the $<$half feeding$>$ value which is specified in the
input file. The $<$half feeding$>$ value is the biomass of prey required
to allow the predator to consume prey at half the maximum consumption
level. The value of $<\psi>$ can have an affect on the growth of the
predator (ie. when there isn't sufficient food available) when the
growth function has been set to "MULTSPEC" or "WeightJones".

Suitability {#sec-suitability}
-----------

The suitability determines how the predators act on the preys. This
selectivity relationship between the predator and the prey is based on
the lengths of the predator and prey, and are defined by declaring a
suitability function and the parameters for that function. The
suitability values can be thought of as the proportion of the prey
length group that the predator length group can consume, and as such the
suitability values should be between 0 and 1.


To define a suitability relationship based on a suitability function,
the stock file (for the predator) needs to contain the following data:

    suitability
    <preyname>    function <functionname> <parameters> ; for each prey

The $<$functionname$>$ defines which suitability function is to be used
to calculate the suitability for the predator acting on the prey.
Currently there are 7 suitability functions defined, and the valid
suitability function names are:


constant - use the Constant suitabilty function straightline - use the
StraightLine suitabilty function exponential - use the Exponential
suitabilty function newexponentiall50 - use the ExponentialL50
suitabilty function richards - use the Richards suitabilty function
andersen - use the Andersen suitabilty function andersenfleet - use the
Andersen suitabilty function, modified for fleets gamma - use the Gamma
suitabilty function


For the following suitability functions, the convention used is to
represent the length group of the prey by l, and the length group of the
predator by L.

### Constant Suitability Function

This is a constant suitability function, where there is no dependence on
either the length of the predator or the length of the prey as given by
the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:constsuit)
S(l, L) = \alpha\end{equation}

Hence, to specify a constant suitability function, the file format
required is:

    <preyname>    function constant <alpha>

### StraightLine Suitability Function

This is a suitability function that has no dependence on the length of
the predator, and a linear dependence on the length of the prey as given
by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:straightsuit)
S(l, L) = \alpha l + \beta\end{equation}

Hence, to specify a straight line suitability function, the file format
required is:

    <preyname>    function straightline <alpha> <beta>

### Exponential Suitability Function

This is a suitability function that has a logarithmic dependence on both
the length of the predator and the length of the prey as given by the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:expsuit)
S(l, L) = {\frac{\delta}{1 + e^{(- \alpha - \beta l - \gamma  L)}}}\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this suitability function, the file format required
is:

    <preyname>    function exponential <alpha> <beta> <gamma> <delta>

### ExponentialL50 Suitability Function

This is a suitability function that has no dependence on the length of
the predator, and a logarithmic dependence on the length of the prey as
given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:l50suit)
S(l, L) = { \frac{1}{1 + e^{ -\alpha (l - l_{50})}}}\end{equation}

Note that the prey length dependence is actually dependant on the
difference between the length of the prey and $l_{50}$, which is the
length of the prey with a 50% probability of predation. Hence, to
specify this suitability function, the file format required is:

    <preyname>    function newexponentiall50 <alpha> <l50>

### Richards Suitability Function

This is a suitability function that is an extension to the Exponential
suitiability function, and has a logarithmic dependence on both the
length of the predator and the length of the prey as given by the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:richsuit)
S(l, L) = \left({\frac{p_3}{1 + e^{(- p_0 - p_1 l - p_2  L)}}}\right) ^ {\frac{1}{p_4}}\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this suitability function, the file format required
is:

    <preyname>    function richards <vector of 5 parameters>

### Andersen Suitability Function

This is a more general suitability function that is dependant on the
ratio of the predator length to the prey length as given by the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:andersensuit)
S(l, L) =
\begin{cases}
p_0 + p_2e^{-\frac{(\ln\frac{L}{l} - p_1)^2}{p_4}} & \textrm{if $\ln\frac{L}{l} \leq p_1$} \\
p_0 + p_2e^{-\frac{(\ln\frac{L}{l} - p_1)^2}{p_3}} & \textrm{if $\ln\frac{L}{l} > p_1$}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

Note that the log of the ratio of the predator/prey lengths is bounded,
to ensure that the suitability function is always well defined. To
specify this suitability function, the file format required is:

    <preyname>    function andersen <vector of 5 parameters>

### Andersen Fleet Suitability Function

This is a modified version of the Andersen suitability function that is
dependant on the ratio of a parameter to the prey length as given by the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:andersenfleetsuit)
S(l, L) =
\begin{cases}
p_0 + p_2e^{-\frac{(\ln\frac{p_5}{l} - p_1)^2}{p_4}} & \textrm{if $\ln\frac{p_5}{l} \leq p_1$} \\
p_0 + p_2e^{-\frac{(\ln\frac{p_5}{l} - p_1)^2}{p_3}} & \textrm{if $\ln\frac{p_5}{l} > p_1$}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

Note that the log of the ratio of the fleet parameter/prey length is
bounded, to ensure that the suitability function is always well defined.
Compared to the standard Andersen suitability function, the additional
parameter is used to replace the predator length and is often used as a
proxy for the mesh size used by the fleets. To specify this suitability
function, the file format required is:

    <preyname>    function andersenfleet <vector of 6 parameters>

### Gamma Suitability Function

This is a suitability function that is only dependant on the prey length
as given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:gammasuit)
S(l, L) = \left(\frac{l}{(\alpha - 1) \beta\gamma}\right) ^ {(\alpha - 1)}e ^ {(\alpha - 1 - \frac{l}{\beta\gamma})}\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this suitability function, the file format required
is:

    <preyname>    function gamma <alpha> <beta> <gamma>

This is a suitability function that is more suitable for use when
considering the predation by a fleet (see
section \@ref(sec-fleetsuit)), where the parameter $<\gamma>$ would
represent the size of the mesh used by the fleet (specified in
centimetres).

Initial Conditions {#sec-stockinitial}
------------------

The initial conditions section of stock file specifies the stock
population at the start of the simulation (ie. at the beginning of the
first timestep specified in the "time" file). This includes setting up
the population size, the length distribution and the mean weight for
each length group. This is done by specifying the minimum and maximum
age and length for the stock on this timestep, and either specifying
parameters to allow Gadget to create a stock distribution based on a
Normal distribution, or the numbers that make up the stock distribution
required.


The format for the initial conditions section of the stock file is given
below:

    initialconditions
    minage                 <minimum age for the initial stock>
    maxage                 <maximum age for the initial stock>
    minlength              <minimum length for the initial stock>
    maxlength              <maximum length for the initial stock>
    dl                     <step size for the initial length groups>
    sdev                   <standard deviation multiplier>
    <initial stock distribution data>

The optional $<$sdev$>$ value is used to scale the standard deviation of
the length of the initial stock. The standard deviation used in
calculating the length distribution will be multiplied by this value. If
it is not specified, then it is assumed to have a value of 1 (ie, no
scaling will take place). The optional $<$dl$>$ value is used to set the
length group divisions for the initial stock population. If this is not
specified, then it is assumed that the initial population will have the
same value for $<$dl$>$ as for the stock, as specified in the main stock
file.


There are three formats for the initial stock distribution data, as
given below:


Normal Condition - use a Normal function to generate the length
distribution, with a relative condition factor to assign a mean weight
to the initial population Normal Parametric - use a Normal function to
generate the length distribution, with a parametric weight-length
relationship to calculate a mean weight for the initial population
Numerical - specify the numbers, and the corresponding mean weights, for
the initial population

### Normal Condition Distribution

To specify an initial stock with the lengths given by a Normal
distribution, and using a relative condition factor to generate the
weights, the main stock file needs to specify the name of a datafile
containing the information about the Normal distribution, as shown
below:

    normalcondfile         <name of the initial stock data file>

The initial stock file contains all the information that Gadget requires
to construct an initial population of the stock. Gadget will construct a
population of 10,000 fish for each age group, with the length groups for
these age groups having a Normal distribution about a specified mean
length with a specified standard deviation. The mean weight for this
initial population is calculated by multiplying the reference weight
(specified in the main stock file) by a relative conditioning factor
(which is typically set to 1).


To get from a population with 10,000 fish in each age group (for each
area) to the initial population used in the model, each age group is
multiplied by an age weighting factor and an area weighting factor.


Hence, the format for the initial stock file is given below:

    <age>  <area>  <age factor>  <area factor>  <mean>  <stddev>  <relcond>

### Normal Parametric Distribution

To specify an initial stock with the lengths given by a Normal
distribution, and using a weight-length relationship to generate the
weights, the main stock file needs to specify the name of a datafile
containing the information about the Normal distribution, as shown
below:

    normalparamfile        <name of the initial stock data file>

The initial stock file contains all the information that Gadget requires
to construct an initial population of the stock. Gadget will construct a
population of 10,000 fish for each age group, with the length groups for
these age groups having a Normal distribution about a specified mean
length with a specified standard deviation. The mean weight for this
initial population is then calculated from the standard weight-length
relationship, as given in
equation \@ref(eq:wlen) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:wlen)
W = \alpha L^{\beta}\end{equation}


To get from a population with 10,000 fish in each age group (for each
area) to the initial population used in the model, each age group is
multiplied by an age weighting factor and an area weighting factor.


Hence, the format for the initial stock file is given below:

    <age>  <area>  <age factor>  <area factor>  <mean>  <stddev>  <alpha>  <beta>

### Numerical Distribution

An alternative approach is to define the initial stock population by
specifying an age-length table, along with the mean weight, for the
initial stock. This approach requires the main stock file to specify a
data file to give the age-length table, as shown below:

    numberfile             <name of the initial stock data file>

The initial stock file contains the age-length table for the initial
population. This file specifies the population, and mean weight, of the
stock for each area, age group and length group combination, as shown
below:

    <area>  <age>  <length>  <number>  <weight>

Note that the $<$length$>$ value refers to the minimum length of the
age-length cell that the initial population will be put into.

Migration {#sec-stockmigrate}
---------

The migration section of the stock file determines if, and how, the
stock will migrate in the Gadget model. The migration of a stock within
a Gadget model is calculated based on migration matrices. The format for
the first part of the migration section is given below:

    doesmigrate            <0 or 1> ; 0 for no migration, 1 for migration

If the stock does not migrate, then the following section doesn't apply,
and the next section of the input file is the maturation, given in
section \@ref(sec-stockmature) below. If the stock does migrate, then
further information about the migration is required. There are currently
2 formats for the migration data, as given in the list below:


Migration Matrices - specify the migration matrices to be used Migration
Ratios - specify the ratio of the stock that moves between areas, and
let Gadget calculate the required matrices based on these ratios

### Migration Matrices

To specify the migration of the stock by defining the migration matrices
directly, the main stock file needs to specify the name of a datafile
containing information about when the migration will take place, and the
name of a datafile containing information about the migration matrices,
as shown below:

    doesmigrate            1
    yearstepfile           <name of the migration timestep data file>
    definematrices         <name of the migration matrix data file>

The migration timestep file contains a simple list of the timesteps that
the migration will take place on, along with the name of the migration
matrix that is to be used on each timestep, as shown below:

    <year>  <step>  <migration matrix>

The migration matrix file contains the migration matrices to be used to
move the stock between the various areas within the Gadget model. Each
matrix is listed, starting with the keyword [migrationmatrix],
followed by the name of the migration matrix, and then the matrix to be
used, as shown below:

    [migrationmatrix]
    name   <migration matrix>
    <migration matrix data>

The $<$migration matrix$>$ data should be a square $n$ x $n$ matrix, for
the $n$ areas that the stock is defined on, with the proportion moving
**from** each area given in the columns, and the proportion moving
**to** each area given in the rows. Since migration shouldn't change the
total number of fish in the model, each column in the matrix should sum
to one.


An example of a migration matrix data for a stock that is defined on two
areas is given below:

    [migrationmatrix]
    name    example
    0.6     0.3
    0.4     0.7

For the migration of the stock in the example shown above, 60% of the
stock that are on area 1 at the start of the migration will move to area
1 (ie. they will stay there) and the remaining 40% will move to area 2.
For the stock that start the timestep on area 2, 30% will move to area 1
and the remaining 70% will stay on area 2.

### Migration Ratios

An alternative approach is to specify the migration of the stock by
defining the ratio of the stock that will migrate between given areas,
and let Gadget calculate the resulting migration matrices to use within
the model. To use this format for the migration data, the main stock
file needs to specify the name of a datafile containing information
about when the migration will take place, and the name of a datafile
containing information about the migration ratios, as shown below:

    doesmigrate            1
    yearstepfile           <name of the migration timestep data file>
    defineratios           <name of the migration ratio data file>

The migration timestep file contains a list of the timesteps that the
migration will take place on, along with the name of the migration
matrix that is to be used on each timestep, in the same format as for
the Migration Matrices, as shown above.


The migration ratio file contains the ratios to be used by Gadget to
construct the migration matrices to move the stock between the various
areas within the Gadget model. Each matrix is listed, starting with the
keyword [migrationmatrix], followed by the name of the migration
matrix, and then a list of the ratios to be used to construct the
matrix, as shown below:

    [migrationmatrix]
    name    <migration matrix>
    <from>  <to>    <ratio>

The migration ratio data is a list of the ratio of the stock that moves
from the $<$from$>$ area to the $<$to$>$ area. Gadget will attempt to
construct the migration matrix based on these ratios. Where the data is
incomplete, Gadget will assume that there is no migration between areas
(ie. fish will stay on the area that they are on at the start of the
timestep). If Gadget cannot construct a (unique) migration matrix, then
the model will stop the current simulation and display an error message.


An example of a migration ratio data for a stock that is defined on two
areas is given below:

    [migrationmatrix]
    name    example
    1       2       0.4
    2       1       0.3

For the migration of the stock in the example shown above, 40% of the
stock that are on area 1 at the start of the migration will move to area
2, and the remaining 60% will stay on area 1. For the stock that start
the timestep on area 2, 30% will move to area 1 and the remaining 70%
will stay on area 2.

Maturation {#sec-stockmature}
----------

The maturation section of the stock file determines if, and how, the
stock will mature in the Gadget model. The format for the first part of
the maturation section is given below:

    doesmature             <0 or 1> ; 0 for no maturation, 1 for maturation

If the stock does not mature, then the following sections don't apply,
and the next section of the input file is the movement, given in
section \@ref(sec-stockmove) below. If the stock does mature, then there
are various different functions that describe how the stock can mature.
The type of maturity function is denoted by a name, as shown below, and
then the data required for that maturity function is given in a
datafile. Thus the format for the maturity data, in the main stock file,
is given below:

    doesmature             1
    maturityfunction       <maturity function>
    maturityfile           <name of the maturity data file>

The $<$maturity function$>$ defines the function that is to be used to
calculate how the stock will mature. Currently there are 4 maturity
functions defined, and the valid maturity function names are:



* `newconstant` - use the Constant maturation function 
* `newconstantweight` -use the ConstantWeight maturation function 
* `fixedlength` - use the FixedLength maturation function 
* `continuous` - use the Continuous maturation function


The format for the data in the maturity data file is dependent on the
maturity function that is to be used. All the maturity functions require
the name of the mature stocks that the immature stock will mature into,
and the ratio of the maturing part of the immature stock that is to
mature into each mature stock. This allows for part of an immature stock
to mature into more than one mature stock, so for example, an immature
stock could mature into either a male mature stock or a female mature
stock.


The maturity functions calculate the proportion of the fish in each
age-length group that will become mature, and then move these fish from
the age-length group for the current stock into the corresponding
age-length group for the mature stock. Note that there is a check to
ensure that the corresponding age-length group exists for the mature
stock, and if it doesn't then the fish don't become mature and will stay
in the immature stock.

### Constant Maturity Function

This maturity function calculates the proportion of an age-length group
of an immature stock that becomes mature according to the maturity
equation \@ref(eq:mat3) given below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:mat3)
P(l, a) = \frac{1}{ 1 + e^{-\alpha(l - l_{50}) -\beta(a - a_{50})}}\end{equation}

The maturity term is a function of $l_{50}$ and $a_{50}$, which are the
length and age where 50% of the stock are mature. For this maturation
function, it is assumed that maturation is an annual event, taking place
on the same timesteps in each year. The file format for this maturity
function is the similar to that for the Continuous maturity function,
and is shown below:

    maturestocksandratios       <stockname i>  <ratio i> ; for each stock i
    coefficients                <alpha>  <l50>  <beta>  <a50>
    maturitysteps               <vector of timesteps>

The $<$maturitysteps$>$ vector is a vector of timesteps that the
maturation process will take place on.

### ConstantWeight Maturity Function

This maturity function is an extension to the Constant maturity
function, with the maturity proportion being calculated according to the
maturity equation \@ref(eq:mat4) given below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:mat4)
P(l, a) = \frac{1}{ 1 + e^{-\alpha(l - l_{50}) -\beta(a - a_{50}) -\gamma(k - k_{50})}}\end{equation}

The maturity function has been extended to include the relative
condition of the stock (calculated by dividing the current weight by the
reference weight) and $k_{50}$ which is the relative condition where 50%
of the stock is mature. The file format for this maturity function is
the similar to that for the Constant maturity function, and is shown
below:

    maturestocksandratios       <stockname i>  <ratio i> ; for each stock i
    coefficients                <alpha>  <l50>  <beta>  <a50>  <gamma>  <k50>
    maturitysteps               <vector of timesteps>

### FixedLength Maturity Function

This maturity function takes a different approach, and bases the
proportion of the immature stock that matures on the length of the
immature stock, as the length varies through the year. This is approach
assumes that the maturation process is the same for each year. The
proportion of the immature stock that matures is given by the
equation \@ref(eq:mat2) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:mat2)
P(l, a) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{if there is an $i$ such that $s_i$ is the current step and $l > l_i$} \\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

For each timestep in the year, the stock is assumed to mature when the
length of the fish reaches a certain value. This length can change for
each timestep. This information is given in a file with the format
specified below:

    maturestocksandratios       <stockname i>  <ratio i> ; for each stock i
    maturitysteps               <vector of timesteps>
    maturitylengths             <vector of lengths>

Note that the $<$maturitysteps$>$ and the $<$maturitylengths$>$ vectors
need to be the same size.

### Continuous Maturity Function

This maturity function calculates the proportion of an age-length group
of an immature stock that becomes mature according to the maturity
equations\@ref(eq:mat1a) and \@ref(eq:mat1b) given below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:mat1a)
P(l, a) = {\frac{1}{1 - M}}{\frac{dM}{dt}}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:mat1b)
M(l_{t},a_{t}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(l_{t} - l_{50}) - \beta(a_{t} - a_{50})}}\end{equation}


The maturity term is a function of $l_{50}$ and $a_{50}$, which are the
length and age where 50% of the stock are mature. This is a continuous
process, with the maturity proportion being calculated on every
timestep. The file format for this maturity function is given below:

    maturestocksandratios       <stockname i>  <ratio i> ; for each stock i
    coefficients                <alpha>  <l50>  <beta>  <a50>

Movement ("Transition") {#sec-stockmove}
-----------------------

The movement section of the stock file determines if, and how, the stock
will move (into a different stock) in the Gadget model. This allows for
a Gadget model to be set up with different stock files for stock that is
the same species, but with differing properties (for instance age or
maturity status) and for the entries to move between these stocks when
required. For the current version of Gadget, the only movement between
stocks that is valid is for the stock in the oldest age group of one
stock to move into a different stock. The format for the first part of
the movement section is given below:

    doesmove               <0 or 1> ; 0 for no movement, 1 for movement

If the stock does not move, then the following section doesn't apply,
and the next section of the input file is the renewal, given in
section \@ref(sec-stockrenew) below. If the stock does move, then the
information required to define the movement is the timestep for the
movement to occur (since the movement is assumed to be an annual event)
and the names of the stocks to move the oldest age group into, along
with the ratio of the oldest age group that will move into that
particular stock. Thus the full format for the movement of the stock is
given below:

    doesmove                    1
    transitionstocksandratios   <stockname i>  <ratio i> ; for each stock i
    transitionstep              <timestep for the stock to move>

The movement function simples move the fish from the oldest age-length
groups for the current stock into the corresponding age-length group for
the stock that the fish will move into (in a similar manner to that used
for the maturation, given in
section \@ref(sec-stockmature)). Note that there is a check to ensure that
the corresponding age-length group exists, and if it doesn't then the
fish don't move and will stay in the oldest age group for current stock,
which is modelled as a plus group.

Renewal ("Recruitment") {#sec-stockrenew}
-----------------------

The renewal section of the stock file determines if, and how, the stock
will be renewed in the Gadget model. The format for the first part of
the renewal section is given below:

    doesrenew              <0 or 1> ; 0 for no renewal, 1 for renewal

If the stock does not renew, then the following sections don't apply,
and the next section of the input file is the spawning, given in
section \@ref(sec-stockspawn) below. If the stock does renew, then further
information is required about the renewal data. This is given in a
separate file, so the format for the renewal data, in the main stock
file, is given below:

    doesrenew              1
    minlength              <minimum length for the recruits>
    maxlength              <maximum length for the recruits>
    dl                     <step size for the recruits>
    <renewal distribution data>

The $<$dl$>$ value is optional, and can be used to specify a different
step size for the recruits than for the stock that the recruits will be
added to. If this value is not specified here then the recruits will be
given the same step length as for the stock they will be added to.


In a similar manner to the format for the initial population (see
section \@ref(sec-stockinitial)) there are three formats for the renewal
distribution data, as given below:


Normal Condition - use a Normal function to generate the length
distribution, with a relative condition factor to assign a mean weight
to the new recruits 
Normal Parametric - use a Normal function to
generate the length distribution, with a parametric weight-length
relationship to calculate a mean weight for the new recruits Numerical -
specify the numbers, and the corresponding mean weights, for the new
recruits

### Normal Condition Distribution

To specify renewal data with the lengths given by a Normal distribution,
and using a relative condition factor to generate the weights, the main
stock file needs to specify the name of a datafile containing the
information about the Normal distribution, as shown below:

    normalcondfile         <name of the renewal data file>

The renewal file contains all the information that Gadget requires to
construct the renewal data for the stock. For each timestep and area,
this file lists the the age of the recruits (which would typically match
the minimum age of the stock that the recruits are to be added to), the
number of recruits (in units of 10,000 fish), parameters used to define
the Normal distribution for length groups of the recruits, and the
relative condition factor, used along with the reference weight to
assign a mean weight for the recruits.


Hence, the format for the renewal file is given below:

    <year>  <step>  <area>  <age>  <number>  <mean>  <stddev>  <relcond>

### Normal Parametric Distribution

To specify renewal data with the lengths given by a Normal distribution,
and using a weight-length relationship to generate the weights, the main
stock file needs to specify the name of a datafile containing the
information about the Normal distribution, as shown below:

    normalparamfile        <name of the renewal data file>

The renewal file contains all the information that Gadget requires to
construct the renewal data for the stock. For each timestep and area,
this file lists the the age of the recruits (which would typically match
the minimum age of the stock that the recruits are to be added to), the
number of recruits (in units of 10,000 fish), parameters used to define
the Normal distribution for length groups of the recruits, and
parameters to define the weight-length relationship for these recruits.


Hence, the format for the renewal file is given below:

    <year>  <step>  <area>  <age>  <number>  <mean>  <stddev>  <alpha>  <beta>

### Numerical Distribution

An alternative approach is to define the renewal data by specifying an
age-length table, along with the mean weight, for each timestep that
will have new fish added to the stock. This approach requires the main
stock file to specify a data file to give the age-length table, as shown
below:

    numberfile             <name of the renewal data file>

The renewal file contains data for an age-length table for each timestep
that will have new fish added to the stock. This file specifies the
number, and mean weight, of the new fish for each timestep, area, age
group and length group combination, as shown below:

    <year>  <step>  <area>  <age>  <length>  <number>  <weight>

Note that the $<$length$>$ value refers to the minimum length of the
age-length cell that the new fish will be put into.

Spawning {#sec-stockspawn}
--------

The spawning section of the stock file determines if, and how, the stock
will spawn in the Gadget model. This covers the mortality and weight
loss from the stock due to the spawning process, and optionally the
creation of a new spawned stock. The format for the first part of the
spawning section is given below:

    doesspawn              <0 or 1> ; 0 for no spawning, 1 for spawning

If the stock does not spawn, then the following sections don't apply,
and the next section of the input file is the straying information,
given in section \@ref(sec-stockstray) below. If the stock does spawn, then further
information is required about the spawning data. This is given in a
separate file, so the format for the spawning data, in the main stock
file, is given below:

    doesspawn              1
    spawnfile              <name of the spawning data file>

The spawning data file defines what happens to the stock as it spawns.
The spawning is length-dependent, and the affect that spawning has on
each length group of the mature stock is given by the spawning
equations\@ref(eq:spawn1) and \@ref(eq:spawn2) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:spawn1)
N = N {\left(1 + P {(e^{-m} - 1)}\right)}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:spawn2)
W = W \frac{\left(1 + P {((2 - w)e^{-m} - 1)}\right)}{\left(1 + P {(2e^{-m} - 1)}\right)}\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the population of the age-length group $<$ W $>$ is
the mean weight of the population of the age-length group $<$ P $>$ is
the proportion of the length group that will spawn $<m>$ is the spawning
mortality for that length group $<w>$ is the spawning weight loss for
that length group


In equation \@ref(eq:spawn1), the population of the age-length cell of the
mature stock is reduced due to the spawning mortality of the fish that
spawn. In equation \@ref(eq:spawn2), the mean weight of the population in the
age-length cell is adjusted to take the reduction in weight of the fish
that spawn, and the change in population, into account.


Spawning is considered to be an annual event, that takes place on the
same timestep and the same area in each year that the spawning occurs.
To model the spawning process as it affects the parent (without the
creation of a child stock), it is necessary to specify the timestep and
area that the spawning will take place on, and the length selection
functions to determine proportion of each length group that will spawn,
and the spawning mortality and weight loss of those that spawn. This is
done in the spawning data file, as shown below:


    spawnsteps             <vector of timesteps>
    spawnareas             <vector of areas>
    firstspawnyear         <first year that the spawning occurs>
    lastspawnyear          <last year that the spawning occurs>
    onlyparent
    proportionfunction     <see Length Selection>
    mortalityfunction      <see Length Selection>
    weightlossfunction     <see Length Selection>

The optional \<firstspawnyear\> and \<lastspawnyear\> values define the
first and last years on which the spawning process will take place. This
means that it is possible to define recruits (see
section \@ref(sec-stockrenew) above) for some years in the model and use a
spawning process in other years in the model. If these are not specified
in the input file, then it assumed that the spawning process will take
place on all years in the simulation, and these will default to the
first year and last year in the simulation.


Alternatively, it is possible to consider the spawning process as part
of a through life-cycle model, and so the spawning process can create
recruits to be added to one or more stocks (in a similar manner to the
renewal data, given in
section \@ref(sec-stockrenew) above). The total number of recruits given
by the spawning process is added to the youngest age group of the
spawned stock at the start of the following timestep. The lengths of the
spawned stock are distributed with a Normal distribution about a
specified mean length $<$mean$>$ with a standard deviation $<$stddev$>$.
The mean weight of the fish in these age length cells is given from
equation \@ref(eq:wlen), with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ specified in the
spawning data file. Hence, if the spawning process is to calculate a
number of recruits to the model, the format for the spawning data file
is shown below:


    spawnsteps             <vector of timesteps>
    spawnareas             <vector of areas>
    firstspawnyear         <first year that the spawning occurs>
    lastspawnyear          <last year that the spawning occurs>
    spawnstocksandratios   <stockname i> <ratio i> ; for each stock i
    proportionfunction     <see Length Selection>
    mortalityfunction      <see Length Selection>
    weightlossfunction     <see Length Selection>
    recruitment            <functionname>  <parameters>
    stockparameters        <mean>  <stddev>  <alpha>  <beta>

The recruitment $<$functionname$>$ defines which recruitment function to
use to calculate the number of recruits to be added to the spawned
stock. Currently there are 4 recruitment functions defined, and the
valid recruitment function names are:


* `fecundity` - use the Fecundity recruitment function
* `simplessb` - use the SimpleSSB recruitment function
* `ricker` - use the Ricker recruitment function
* `bevertonholt` - use the BevertonHolt recruitment function

### Fecundity Recruitment Function

This recruitment function calculates the number of recruits to be added
to the spawned stock as a function of the length, age, number and weight
of the spawning stock, given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:rec1)
R = p_{0} \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} l ^{p_{1}} a ^{p_{2}} N_{al} ^{p_{3}} W_{al} ^{p_{4}}\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this recruitment function, the file format required
is:


    recruitment            fecundity  <vector of 5 parameters>

 
### SimpleSSB Recruitment Function

This recruitment function calculates the number of recruits to be added
to the spawned stock as a simple proportion of the spawning stock
biomass, given by the following equations:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:ssb)
S = \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} N_{al} W_{al}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:rec2)
R = \mu S\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this recruitment function, the file format required
is:


    recruitment            simplessb  <mu>

### Ricker Recruitment Function

This recruitment function calculates the number of recruits to be added
to the spawned stock, as a function of the spawning stock biomass (see
equation \@ref(eq:ssb)), based on the Ricker recruitment relationship given
by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:rec3)
R = \mu S e ^{-\lambda S}\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this recruitment function, the file format required
is:


    recruitment            ricker  <mu>  <lambda>

### BevertonHolt Recruitment Function

This recruitment function calculates the number of recruits to be added
to the spawned stock, as a function of the spawning stock biomass (see
equation \@ref(eq:ssb)), based on the Beverton Holt recruitment
relationship given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:rec4)
R = \frac{\mu S}{\lambda + S}\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this recruitment function, the file format required
is:


    recruitment            bevertonholt  <mu>  <lambda>

### Hockey stick Recruitment Function

This recruitment function calculates the number of recruits to be added
to the spawned stock, as a function of the spawning stock biomass (see
equation \@ref(eq:ssb)), based on the Hockey stick recruitment relationship
given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:rec5)
R =  \begin{cases}
R_0,&\text{If } B_{lim} \leq S \\
\frac{R_0S}{B_{lim}} & \text{If } 0 \leq S \leq B_{lim}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this recruitment function, the file format required
is:


    recruitment            hockeystick  <R_0>  <B_lim>

Note that to be in-line with definition of renewals and initial
conditions $R_0$ is defined in terms multiples of 10 000 fish.

### Baleen Recruitment Function

This recruitment function calculates the number of recruits to be added
to the spawned stock, as a function of the spawning stock abundance (see
equation \@ref(eq:ssb)), based on the Baleen recruitment relationship
given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:rec6)
R =  B S (1 + A(1 - (S/K))^z)
\end{equation}

Hence, to specify this recruitment function, the file format required
is:

    recruitment            baleen  <B>  <A> <K> <z>

where $B$ is the birthrate, $A$ is the resilience parameter for the stock, $K$ the carrying capacity and $z$ the degree of compensation. 

Length Selection {#sec-lselection}
----------------

The length selection function determines the proportion of the length
group that will be selected, in a similar way to the suitability
functions (see section \@ref(sec-suitability) above). To define a length selection
function, it is necessary to specify the function, the name of the
function ans the parameters for the function, as shown below:


    <function>    <functionname> <parameters>

The $<$function$>$ defines how the length selection function will be
used (for an example, see
section \@ref(sec-stockspawn) above). The $<$functionname$>$ defines which
selection function is to be used to calculate the selection of the
stock. Currently there are three selection functions defined, and the
valid length selection function names are:


* `constant` - use the Constant selection function
* `straightline` - use the StraightLine selection function 
* `exponential` - use the Exponential selection function

### Constant Selection Function

This is a selection function, where there is no dependence on the length
of the stock is given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:constsel)
S(l) = \alpha
\end{equation}

Hence, to specify a constant selection function, the file format
required is:


    <function>    constant  <alpha>

### StraightLine Selection Function

This is a selection function that has a linear dependence on the length
of the stock is given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:straightsel)
S(l) = \alpha l + \beta\end{equation}


Hence, to specify a straight line selection function, the file format
required is:


    <function>    straightline  <alpha>  <beta>

### Exponential Selection Function

This is a selection function that has a logarithmic dependence on the
length of the stock is given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:expsel)
S(l) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{ \alpha (l - l_{50})}}\end{equation}


Note that the stock length dependence is actually dependant on the
difference between the length of the stock and $l_{50}$, which is the
length of the stock with a 50% probability of selection. Hence, to
specify this selection function, the file format required is:


    <function>    exponential  <alpha>  <l50>

Straying {#sec-stockstray}
--------

The straying section of the stock file determines if, and how, the stock
will stray from one substock to another substock in the Gadget model.
The format for the first part of the straying section of the stock file
is given below:


    doesstray              <0 or 1> ; 0 for no straying, 1 for straying

If the stock does not stray, then the following section doesn't apply,
and the stock file is complete. If the stock does stray, then further
information is required about the straying data. This is given in a
separate file, so the format for the straying data, in the main stock
file, is given below:


    doesstray              1
    strayfile              <name of the straying data file>

The straying data file defines what happens to the stock as it strays
from one substock to another. The straying is length-dependent, so that
a proportion of each length group (over all age groups) will move to the
corresponding length group in a different substock. This process can be
thought of as an extension to the transition process (see
section \@ref(sec-stockmove)).


Straying is considered to be an annual event, that takes place on the
same timestep and the same area in each year. To model the straying
process in Gadget, it is necessary to specify the timestep and the area
that the straying will take place on, the the names of the stocks to
move the straying fish into, along with the ratio of the fish that will
move into that particular stock (in a similar manner to that used for
the transition process) and the length selection function to determine
the proportion of the length group that will stray. This is done in the
straying data file, as shown below:


    straysteps             <vector of timesteps>
    strayareas             <vector of areas>
    straystocksandratios   <stockname i> <ratio i> ; for each stock i
    proportionfunction     <see Length Selection>

Tag Files {#chap-tag}
=========

The tag files contain the information about the tagging experiments that
are to be included in the Gadget model. Gadget will keep track of the
number, and proportion, of fish in an age-length cell that have been
tagged for a tagging experiment. This information can then be compared
to the recaptures from that tagging experiment when calculating a
likelihood score (see Recaptures,
section \@ref(sec-recaptures)).


To define tagged populations in the Gadget model, the "main" file must
contain a list of the data files that contain the description of the
tagging experiments, and the format for this is shown below:


    [tagging]
    tagfiles               <names of the tag files>

The main tag file lists the tagging experiments, along with basic
information about the experiments and the name of the datafile that
contains information about the number of fish tagged for the tagging
experiment. The format for this file shown below, with each new tagging
experiment starting with the keyword [component]:


    [component]
    tagid                  <name of the tagging experiment>
    stock                  <name of the tagged stock>
    tagarea                <area that the tagging took place>
    endyear                <year of last recapture>
    tagloss                <proportion of tagged fish that are lost>
    numbers                <see Tagging Numbers>

Each tagging experiment is defined by specifying the name of the tagging
experiment, the stock that is tagged for the tagging experiment, and the
area that the tagging took place on. Note that it is currently possible
to only tag one stock, on one area, for each tagging experiment.


The optional $<$endyear$>$ value is used to define the end of a tagging
experiment, and should be set to the year of the last expected recapture
from the tagging experiment. This can be used to reduce the calculation
time. If this is not specified, then it is assumed that the tagging
experiment will run until the end of the simulation.


The $<$tagloss$>$ value is used to remove tagged fish from the model.
For each time step, a number of tags can be lost from the tagging
experiment. The number of tagged fish that remain in the tagging
experiment is given by the
equation \@ref(eq:tagloss) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:tagloss)
N = N (e^{-t})\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the number of tagged fish in an age-length group
$<t>$ is the proportion of tagged fish that are lost, as specified in
the input file

Tagging Numbers {#sec-tagnumbers}
---------------

The numbers section of the tag file gives the number of fish tagged for
the tagging experiment. This is given in a column format in a separate
file, so the main tag file simply gives the name of this tag data file,
as shown in the example below:


    numbers                <name of data file>

For the tag datafile, this is a simple list of tag identifier, timestep,
length and then the number of fish tagged, for that tag/timestep/length
combination. This format is shown below:


    <tagid>  <year>  <step>  <length>  <number>

Note that the $<$length$>$ value refers to the minimum length of the
length cell that the tagged fish will be put into.

Otherfood Files {#chap-other}
===============

The otherfood files contain the information about non-dynamic prey that
is available for the predators to consume. The otherfood acts as a prey
that is always available, and it is used to avoid the situation where
the non-availability of a prey stock prevents the predators from growing
as expected.


To define otherfood in the Gadget model, the "main" file must contain a
list of the data files that contain the description of the otherfood,
and the format for this is shown below:


    [otherfood]
    otherfoodfiles         <names of the otherfood files>

The main otherfood file lists the otherfood, along with basic
information about the food and the name of the datafile that contains
information about the amount of food that is available for the predators
to eat. The format for this file shown below, with each new otherfood
starting with the keyword [component]:


    [component]
    foodname               <food name>
    livesonareas           <areas>
    lengths                <min>  <max>
    energycontent          <energy value>
    amount                 <see Food Amounts>

The otherfood is defined by specifying the otherfood name and areas it
is available for consumption on and the minimum and maximum length of
food (for compatibility with the dynamic stock predation and printer
classes).

Food Amounts {#sec-foodamounts}
------------

The amounts section of the otherfood file gives the biomass of otherfood
that is available for the predators to eat. This data is listed in a
column format in a separate file, so the main otherfood file simply
gives the name of this otherfood data file, as shown in the example
below:


    amount                 <name of data file>

For the otherfood datafile, this is a simple list of year, timestep,
area, food name and then the biomass of the food available for the
predators to eat, for that timestep/area combination. This format is
shown below:


    <year>  <step>  <area>  <food name>  <amount>

Fleet Files {#chap-fleet}
===========

The fleet files contain the information about the fleets that are
reducing the population of the stocks in the Gadget model. The fleets
act as a simple predator in the model, with the landings data treated as
the fleets "consumption" of the stock that is caught.


To define fleets in the Gadget model, the "main" file must contain a
list of the data files that contain the description of the fleets, and
the format for this is shown below:


    [fleet]
    fleetfiles             <names of the fleet files>

There are 5 types of fleets implemented in Gadget, and the main fleet
file lists the fleets and their type, along with information about the
fleet and the name of the datafile that contains information about the
landings. The format for this file shown below, with each new fleet
starting with the keyword [component]:


    [component]
    <type>                 <fleetname>
    <fleet data>

The fleet data for each fleet type is covered in the sub sections below.
The $<$type$>$ defines the type of fleet for the $<$fleetname$>$ fleet,
and the 5 valid fleet types that can used in Gadget are:


    TotalFleet 
    NumberFleet 
    LinearFleet 
    EffortFleet 
    QuotaFleet

TotalFleet {#sec-totalfleet}
----------

The fleet type used that creates a predator based on the landings data
(by biomass) for the fleet is called "TotalFleet". This total amount
landed is then split between the various stocks, and length groups of
the stocks, according to
equation \@ref(eq:tcons) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:tcons)
C_{s}(l) = \frac{E S_{s}(l) N_{sl} W_{sl}}{\displaystyle \sum_{\it stocks} \sum_{\it lengths} S_{s}(l) N_{sl} W_{sl}}\end{equation}

where: $<$ E $>$ is the biomass caught by the fleet $<$ N $>$ is the
number of stock in the length cell $<$ W $>$ is the mean weight of the
stock in the length cell $<$ S $>$ is the suitability function (see
section \@ref(sec-fleetsuit))


This fleet type is defined by specifying the fleet name and areas it
operates on, along with a suitability function for each stock that the
fleet will catch and a data file listing the biomass that the fleet will
catch. The file format for the TotalFleet is given below:


    [component]
    totalfleet             <fleetname>
    livesonareas           <areas>
    multiplicative         <multi>
    suitability            <see Fleet Suitability>
    amount                 <see Fleet Amounts>

The optional $<$multi$>$ value is a multiplicative constant used to
scale the data if required - the default value for this multiplier is 1
(ie. no scaling).


The fleets act as a predator, so Gadget also requires a suitability
function to be defined for the predation of the stocks in the model. The
total amount that has been landed by the fleet is also required - this
is taken from the landings data, based on timestep and area, and is
specified in a separate file.

NumberFleet {#sec-numberfleet}
-----------

The fleet type used that creates a predator based on the number of the
stock landed (not the biomass) is called "NumberFleet". This total
number caught is then split between the various stocks, and length
groups of the stocks, according to
equation \@ref(eq:ncons) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:ncons)
C_{s}(l) = \frac{E S_{s}(l) N_{sl}}{\displaystyle \sum_{\it stocks} \sum_{\it lengths} S_{s}(l) N_{sl}}\end{equation}

where: $<$ E $>$ is the number caught by the fleet $<$ N $>$ is the
number of stock in the length cell $<$ S $>$ is the suitability function
(see section \@ref(sec-fleetsuit))


This fleet type is defined by specifying the fleet name and areas it
operates on, along with a suitability function for each stock that the
fleet will catch and a data file listing the numbers that the fleet will
catch. The file format for the NumberFleet is given below:


    [component]
    numberfleet            <fleetname>
    livesonareas           <areas>
    multiplicative         <multi>
    suitability            <see Fleet Suitability>
    amount                 <see Fleet Amounts>

The optional $<$multi$>$ value is a multiplicative constant used to
scale the data if required - the default value for this multiplier is 1
(ie. no scaling).


The fleets act as a predator, so Gadget also requires a suitability
function to be defined for the predation of the stocks in the model. The
total number of fish that has been caught by the fleet is also required
- this is taken from the landings data, based on timestep and area, and
is specified in a separate file.

LinearFleet {#sec-linearfleet}
-----------

The fleet type used that creates a predator that removes the caught fish
based on the available biomass of the stock multiplied by a scaling
factor is called "LinearFleet". The biomass caught is then split between
the various stocks, and length groups of the stocks, according to
equation \@ref(eq:lcons) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:lcons)
C_{s}(l) = E \Delta t S_{s}(l) N_{sl} W_{sl}\end{equation}

where: $<$ E $>$ is the scaling factor for the stock that is to be
caught, per month $<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep $<$ N $>$
is the number of stock in the length cell $<$ W $>$ is the mean weight
of the stock in the length cell $<$ S $>$ is the suitability function
(see section \@ref(sec-fleetsuit))


This fleet type is defined by specifying the fleet name and areas it
operates on, along with a suitability function for each stock that the
fleet will catch and a data file listing the fishing level for the
fleet. The file format for the LinearFleet is given below:


    [component]
    linearfleet            <fleetname>
    livesonareas           <areas>
    multiplicative         <multi>
    suitability            <see Fleet Suitability>
    amount                 <see Fleet Amounts>

The optional $<$multi$>$ value is a multiplicative constant used to
scale the data if required - the default value for this multiplier is 1
(ie. no scaling).


The fleets act as a predator, so Gadget also requires a suitability
function to be defined for the predation of the stocks in the model. The
scaling factor to be used when calculating the amount that the fleet
will catch is also required, and this is specified in a separate file.


The fleet of type LinearFleet acts a simple predator, and can be used
for fleets acting in the future, when the landings data is not
available.

EffortFleet {#sec-effortfleet}
-----------

The fleet type used that creates a predator that removes the caught fish
based on the available biomass of the stock multiplied by a scaling
factor and a 'catchability' parameter for that stock is called
"EffortFleet". The biomass caught is then split between the various
stocks, and length groups of the stocks, according to
equation \@ref(eq:econs) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:econs)
C_{s}(l) = E q_{s} \Delta t S_{s}(l) N_{sl} W_{sl}\end{equation}

where: $<$ E $>$ is the scaling factor for the stock that is to be
caught, per month $<$ q $>$ is the catchability parameter for that stock
$<\Delta t>$ is the length of the timestep $<$ N $>$ is the number of
stock in the length cell $<$ W $>$ is the mean weight of the stock in
the length cell $<$ S $>$ is the suitability function (see
section \@ref(sec-fleetsuit))


This fleet type is defined by specifying the fleet name and areas it
operates on, along with a suitability function and catchability
parameter for each stock that the fleet will catch and a data file
listing the proportion of each stock that the fleet will catch. The file
format for the EffortFleet is given below:


    [component]
    effortfleet            <fleetname>
    livesonareas           <areas>
    multiplicative         <multi>
    suitability            <see Fleet Suitability>
    catchability           <stock catchability parameters>
    amount                 <see Fleet Amounts>

The optional $<$multi$>$ value is a multiplicative constant used to
scale the data if required - the default value for this multiplier is 1
(ie. no scaling).


The fleets act as a predator, so Gadget also requires a suitability
function to be defined for the predation of the stocks in the model. The
scaling factor to be used when calculating the amount that the fleet
will catch is also required, and this is specified in a separate file.


The fleet of type EffortFleet is a multi-species extension to the fleet
of type LinearFleet (see
section \@ref(sec-linearfleet) above). This means that when a fleet is
used to catch more than one species (either directly or as bycatch) the
different catchability for these species can be taken into account. This
catchability parameter is specified by listing the names of the prey and
the associated preference value, as shown in the example below:


    ...
    catchability
    <name of stock 1>      <catchability for stock 1>
    <name of stock 2>      <catchability for stock 2>
    amount
    ...

QuotaFleet {#sec-quotafleet}
----------

The fleet type used that creates a predator that removes the caught fish
based on the available biomass of the stock multiplied by a scaling
factor set according to a simple harvest control rule is called
"QuotaFleet". The biomass caught is then split between the various
stocks, and length groups of the stocks, according to
equation \@ref(eq:lcons) (see
section \@ref(sec-linearfleet) above). The scaling factor (the parameter
"E" in the equation above) is set according to a simple harvest control
rule.


This fleet type is defined by specifying the fleet name and areas it
operates on, along with a suitability function for each stock that the
fleet will catch, a simple harvest control rule and a data file listing
the proportion of each stock that the fleet will catch. The file format
for the QuotaFleet is given below:


    [component]
    quotafleet             <fleetname>
    livesonareas           <areas>
    multiplicative         <multi>
    suitability            <see Fleet Suitability>
    quotafunction          <function name>
    biomasslevel           <vector of biomass levels>
    quotalevel             <vector of quota levels>
    amount                 <see Fleet Amounts>

The optional $<$multi$>$ value is a multiplicative constant used to
scale the data if required - the default value for this multiplier is 1
(ie. no scaling).


The fleets act as a predator, so Gadget also requires a suitability
function to be defined for the predation of the stocks in the model. A
scaling factor that can be used when calculating the amount that the
fleet will catch is also required, and this is specified in a separate
file (although this is usually set to 1, since the scaling factor to be
used is multiplied by that calculated using the simple harvest control
rule below).


The simple harvest control rule that is used to calculate the scaling
factor to be used to determine the fishing level is defined by the
$<$function name$>$ value, along with the $<$biomasslevel$>$ and
$<$quotalevel$>$ vectors. Currently there are 6 quota functions defined,
and the valid function names are:


* `simple` - use a simple harvest control rule, based on the biomass of each stock
* `annual` - use a annual harvest control rule, based on the biomass of each stock
* `simplesum` - use a simple harvest control rule, based on the biomass of all the stocks
* `annualsum` - use a annual harvest control rule, based on the biomass of all the stocks
* `simpleselect` - use a simple harvest control rule, based on the biomass of selected stocks
* `annualselect` - use a annual harvest control rule, based on the biomass of selected stocks


Note that if the $<$function name$>$ value is set to either simpleselect
or annualselect, then it is necessary to define which stocks to use to
determine the fishing level. This is done be additionally specifying a
$<$selectstocks$>$ vector which is a list of the stocks to use, as given
in the list below:


    ...
    biomasslevel           <vector of biomass levels>
    quotalevel             <vector of quota levels>
    selectstocks           <vector of stocks to base the quote on>
    amount                 <see Fleet Amounts>

The $<$biomasslevel$>$ vector is a list of $n$ biomass points at which
the fishing level will change, and the $<$quotalevel$>$ vector is the
corresponding list of $n+1$ fishing levels. Note that the first
quotalevel value corresponds to the fishing level that will be used when
the biomass is between 0 and the first biomasslevel value, so the
quotalevel vector must have one more entry than the biomasslevel vector.


An example of valid biomasslevel and quotalevel vectors is given below:


    biomasslevel           10000  250000
    quotalevel             0.1  0.4  0.9

The fishing level for the stock in the example shown above would be set
to 0.1 if the biomass of the stock is less than 10,000 kilogrammes, 0.4
if the biomass is between 10,000 and 250,000 kilogrammes and 0.9 if the
biomass is above 250,000 kilogrammes. Note that the biomasslevel vector
has 2 entries, and that the quotalevel vector has a third entry.

Fleet Suitability {#sec-fleetsuit}
-----------------

The suitability determines how the fleets act on the stocks that are
caught. Since Gadget treats the fleets as predators of the stocks, the
format for the suitability functions for the fleets is the same as the
format for the suitability functions of the stock when they are acting
as a predator. The format for the suitability functions as discussed in
section \@ref(sec-suitability) above. Note that in the equations for the
suitability functions, the 'length' of the predator is a meaningless
concept when the predator is a fleet.

Fleet Amounts {#sec-fleetamount}
-------------

The amounts section of the fleet file gives the landings data for the
fleets. This data is listed in a column format in a separate file, so
the main fleet file simply gives the name of this fleet data file, as
shown in the example below:


    amount                 <name of data file>

For fleets of type TotalFleet or NumberFleet, the data file is a list of
year, timestep, area, fleetname and then the amount of catch landed
(either biomass or number), taken from landings data, for that
timestep/area/fleet combination:


    <year>  <step>  <area>  <fleetname>  <amount>

For fleets of type LinearFleet, EffortFleet or QuotaFleet, the data file
is a list of year, timestep, area, fleetname and then the scaling factor
to be used when calculating the amount of the catch for that
timestep/area/fleet combination:


    <year>  <step>  <area>  <fleetname>  <scaling factor>

Likelihood Files {#chap-like}
================

The likelihood files are used to define the various likelihood
components that are used to calculate the "goodness of fit" of the
Gadget model to the available data. Each likelihood component will
calculate a likelihood score for that individual component, and there is
then a weighted sum of all the likelihood scores to calculate an overall
likelihood score. It is this overall likelihood score that the optimiser
attempts to minimise during an optimising run.


To define likelihood files in the Gadget model, the "main" file must
contain a list of the data files that contain the description of the
likelihood classes required, and the format for this is shown below:

```
[likelihood]
likelihoodfiles      <names of the likelihood files>
```

The likelihood files contain a list of various type of likelihood
classes, separated by the keyword [component] that control the
different likelihood components in the model, the name and weight for
that likelihood component and various likelihood data, depending in the
likelihood component type. The format of the likelihood files is
follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 <likelihood type>
<likelihood data>
```

The likelihood data for each likelihood type is covered in the sub
sections below. The $<$likelihood type$>$ defines the type of likelihood
component that is to be used, and there are currently 12 valid
likelihood types defined in Gadget. These are:

* `BoundLikelihood` 
* `Understocking` 
* `CatchDistribution` 
* `CatchStatistics`
* `StockDistribution` 
* `SurveyIndices`
* `SurveyDistribution` 
* `StomachContent`
* `Recaptures` 
* `RecStatistics` 
* `MigrationPenalty` 
* `MigrationProportion`
* `CatchInKilos`

BoundLikelihood ("Penalty") {#sec-boundlike}
---------------------------

The BoundLikelihood likelihood component is used to give a penalty
weight to parameters that have moved beyond the bounds, as specified in
the parameter file, in the optimisation process. This file does not
specify the bounds that are to be used, only the penalty that is to be
applied when these bounds are exceeded. Since the Simmulated Annealing
(see section \@ref(sec-simann)) algorithm will always choose a value for the
parameter that is within the bounds, this likelihood component will
return a zero likelihood score during an optimisation using that
algorithm. However, both the Hooke & Jeeves (see
section \@ref(sec-hooke))
and the BFGS (see section \@ref(sec-bfgs)) algorithms can choose a parameter outside the
specified bounds, and so this likelihood component can then return a
positive score.


To specify a BoundLikelihood likelihood component, the format required
in the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 penalty
datafile             <name for the datafile>
```

The datafile defines the penalty that is to be applied to the parameter
when it exceeds the bounds, as given by
equation \@ref(eq:bound) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:bound)
\ell_{i} =
\begin{cases}
lw_{i} (val_{i} - lb_{i})^{p_{i}} & \textrm{if $val_{i} < lb_i$} \\
uw_{i} (val_{i} - ub_{i})^{p_{i}} & \textrm{if $val_{i} > ub_i$} \\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

where: $<val_i>$ is the value of the parameter $<lw_i>$ is the weight
applied when the parameter exceeds the lower bound $<uw_i>$ is the
weight applied when the parameter exceeds the upper bound $<lb_i>$ is
the lower bound $<ub_i>$ is the upper bound $<p_i>$ is the power
coefficient

Note that when the value of the parameter is exactly equal to the bound,
this equation will give a zero likelihood score.


The datafile lists these weights and the power that is to be used for
each parameter. The format for this file is shown below:

```
<switch>  <power>  <lower>  <upper>
```

where $<$lower$>$ is the weighting used when the parameter hits the
lower bound, and $<$upper$>$ is the weighting used when the parameter
hits the upper bound, for the parameter with the name $<$switch$>$.


It is possible to define a default penalty that is used for all switches
that are not defined separately. To do this, simply enter a line in the
data file with the switch name given as "default", and then the power,
lower and upper weights that are required. For example:

```
default    2        1000     1000
```

would define a default penalty, where the lower and upper weights were
1000, and the power was 2.

Understocking {#sec-understocking}
-------------

The Understocking likelihood component calculates a penalty that is
applied if there are an insufficient number of a particular prey to meet
the requirements of the predators. In the case of a fleet, this means
that the landings data indicates that more fish have been landed than
there are fish in the model, for that timetep and area combination. A
well defined model will have a zero likelihood score from this
component. The likelihood component that is used is the sum of squares
of the overconsumption, given by the equation below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:understocking)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \Big(\sum_{\it preys} U_{trp} \Big)^p\end{equation}

where: $<$ U $>$ is the understocking that has occurred in the model $<$
p $>$ is the power coefficient (which should be 2 for sum of squares
fit)


To specify an Understocking likelihood component, the format required in
the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 understocking
powercoeff           <power>
```

The $<$power$>$ value is optional, and if this is not given, the power
coefficient is assumed to be 2, giving a sum of squares equation for
this likelihood component.

CatchDistribution {#sec-catchdist}
-----------------

The CatchDistribution likelihood component is used to compare
distribution data sampled from the model with distribution data sampled
from landings or surveys. The distribution data can either be aggregated
into age groups (giving a distribution of length groups for each age),
length groups (giving a distribution of age groups for each length) or
into age-length groups. The likelihood score that is calculated gives
some measure as to how well the data from the model fit to the data from
the sample catches.


To specify a CatchDistribution likelihood component, the format required
in the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 catchdistribution
datafile             <name for the datafile>
function             <function name>
<multivariate parameters>
aggregationlevel     <0 or 1> ; 1 to aggregate data over the whole year
overconsumption      <0 or 1> ; 1 to take overconsumption into account
epsilon              <epsilon>
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
ageaggfile           <age aggregation file specifying ages>
lenaggfile           <length aggregation file specifying lengths>
fleetnames           <vector of the names of the fleets>
stocknames           <vector of the names of the stocks>
```

The optional flag $<$aggregationlevel$>$ is used to specify whether the
distribution data should be aggregated over the whole year (by setting
aggregation level to 1) or not aggregated, and calculated for each
timestep (by setting aggregation level to 0). If this line is not
specified, then an aggregation level of 0 is assumed, and the
distribution data is not aggregated over the whole year. Note that not
all of the functions used to compare the data can aggregate the data
over the whole year.


The optional flag $<$overconsumption$>$ is used to specify whether any
over consumption of the stock is to be taken into account when
calculating the model distribution. If this is set to 1, then the model
catch data will be adjusted to ensure that the fleets don't catch more
stock than is available, by applying a bound to the catch of the fleets.
If this line is not specified, then an overconsumption of 0 is assumed
and any understocking that is present in the model is ignored, which can
lead to an unrealistic result if the understocking likelihood component
is not specified.


The optional $<$epsilon$>$ value is used whenever the calculated
probability is very unlikely, although the exact format of this depends
on the function that is to be used when calculating the likelihood
score. This means that the likelihood component is not dominated by one
or two stray values, since these will be reset back to less unlikely
values. The default value for $<$epsilon$>$ is 10, which is used
whenever it is not defined in the input file.


The $<$fleetnames$>$ vector contains a list of all the fleets to be
aggregated into a single pseudo fleet for the purposes of the data
comparison. Similarly, the $<$stocknames$>$ vector contains a list of
all the stocks to be aggregated into a single pseudo stock.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled age-length catch distribution to the input
age-length catch distribution. Currently, there are 8 likelihood
functions defined, and the valid function names are:


- `sumofsquares` - use a sum of squares function
- `stratified` - use a stratified sum of squares function
- `multinomial` - use a multinomial function
- `pearson` - use a Pearson function
- `gamma` - use a gamma function
- `log` - use a log function
- `mvn` - use a multivariate normal function
- `mvlogistic` - use a multivariate logistic function


The $<$multivariate parameters$>$ are only required for the multivariate
functions, and Gadget will generate an error if they are specified when
they are not required. These parameters are described in the following
sections.


Finally, the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ contains a list of the
age-length catch distribution that Gadget is to use to fit the
likelihood function to, aggregated according to the aggregation files
specified, for the numbers calculated in the model. The format of this
file is given below:

```
<year>  <step>  <area>  <age>  <length>  <number>
```

where $<$number$>$ is the number of samples for the
timestep/area/age/length combination.

### Sum of Squares Function

The sum of squares function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:catchdist4) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist4)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big( \frac{N_{tral}}{N_{tr}} - \frac{\nu_{tral}}{\nu_{tr}}  \Big) ^2\end{equation}

where: $< N_{tral} >$ is the data sample size for that time/area/age/length
combination $< \nu_{tral} >$ is the model sample size for that time/area/age/length
combination. $< N_{tr} >$ and $< \nu_{tr} >$ is the total data and model
sample size for that time/area combination respectively.

### Stratified Sum of Squares Function

The stratified function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:catchdist4s) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist4s)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big( \frac{N_{tral}}{N_{trl}} - \frac{\nu_{tral}}{\nu_{trl}}  \Big) ^2\end{equation}

The difference between this function
and the sum of squares function above is in the way the proportions of
the samples are calculated - for this function the proportion is
calculated for each length group in turn, whereas for the sum of squares
function the proportion is taken over all the length groups. If there is
only one length group then these two functions are identical.

### Multinomial Function

The multinomial function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:catchdist1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist1)
\ell = 2 \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages} \Bigg( \log N_{tra}! - \sum_{\it lengths} \log N_{tral}! + \sum_{\it lengths} \Big( N_{tral} \log {\frac{\nu_{tral}}{\sum \nu_{tral}}} \Big) \Bigg)\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the data sample size for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\nu>$ is the model sample size for that
time/area/age/length combination

### Pearson Function

The Pearson function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:catchdist2) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist2)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big( {\frac{ ( N_{tral} - \nu_{tral} ) ^2} {\nu_{tral} + \epsilon}} \Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the data sample size for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\nu>$ is the model sample size for that
time/area/age/length combination

### Gamma Function

The gamma function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:catchdist3) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist3)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big( {\frac{ N_{tral}} { (\nu_{tral} + \epsilon )} + \log ({\nu_{tral} + \epsilon}}) \Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the data sample size for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\nu>$ is the model sample size for that
time/area/age/length combination

### Log Function

The log function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:catchdist7) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist7)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \Big( \log \Big( {\frac{ \displaystyle \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \nu_{tral}} { \displaystyle \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} N_{tral}}} \Big) \Big) ^2\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the data sample size for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\nu>$ is the model sample size for that
time/area/age/length combination

### Multivariate Normal Function

The multivariate normal function calculates the likelihood component
from equation \@ref(eq:catchdist5) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist5)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages} \Big( log|\Sigma| + (P_{tra} - \pi_{tra})^T \Sigma^{-1}(P_{tra} - \pi_{tra}) \Big)\end{equation}

where: $<\Sigma>$ is the variance-covariance matrix for the multivariate
normal distribution $<$ P $>$ is the proportion of the data sample for
that time/area/age combination $<\pi>$ is the proportion of the model
sample for that time/area/age combination


For the formulation of the variance-covariance matrix, $<\Sigma>$ is
calculated from equations
\@ref(eq:cdsigma1) and
\@ref(eq:cdsigma2) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:cdsigma1)
\Sigma = (\sigma_{ij})_{ij}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:cdsigma2)
\sigma_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \sum^{lag}_{l=1} c_l \sigma_{i-l,j} + \delta^i_{j} \sigma^2 & \textrm{if $i \geq j$} \\
\displaystyle \sum^{lag}_{l=1} c_l \sigma_{j,i-l} & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

In equation \@ref(eq:cdsigma2) it is assumed that the number in each length
group is autocorrelated with lag $<$ lag $>$. Note that setting the lag
to be zero simplifies the multivariate normal distribution to a
univariate one.


To specify this likelihood function, it is necessary to specify the
parameters $<\sigma>$ and $<$ lag $>$ and a list of $<$ lag $>$
correlation parameters. This is done in the likelihood file, as shown
below:

```
...
function             mvn
lag                  <lag>
sigma                <sigma>
param                <correlation parameter> ; note that a total of
param                <correlation parameter> ; <lag> correlation
...                                          ; parameters are required
aggregationlevel     <0 or 1> ; 1 to aggregate data over the whole year
...
```

### Multivariate Logistic Function

The multivariate logistic function calculates the likelihood component
from equations
\@ref(eq:catchdist6a) and
\@ref(eq:catchdist6b) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist6a)
\ell = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{\it time} \Big((L - 1) log(\sigma)+\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \tau_{tral}^2 \Big)\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchdist6b)
\tau_{tral} = log(P_{tral}) - log(\pi_{tral}) - \frac{1}{L}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big(log(P_{tral}) - log(\pi_{tral}) \Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ L $>$ is the number of length groups $<$ P $>$ is the
proportion of the data sample for that time/area/age/length combination
$<\pi>$ is the proportion of the model sample for that
time/area/age/length combination


To specify this likelihood function it is necessary to specify the
parameter $<\sigma>$. This is done in the likelihood file as shown
below:

```
...
function             mvlogistic
sigma                <sigma>
aggregationlevel     <0 or 1> ; 1 to aggregate data over the whole year
...
```

CatchStatistics {#sec-catchstat}
---------------

The CatchStatistics likelihood component is used to compare statistical
data sampled from the model with statistical data sampled from landings
or surveys. This is typically used to compare biological data, such as
the mean length at age or mean weight at age. The likelihood score that
is calculated gives some measure as to how well the data from the model
fits to the data from the landings.


To specify a CatchStatistics likelihood component, the format required
in the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 catchstatistics
datafile             <name for the datafile>
function             <function name>
overconsumption      <0 or 1> ; 1 to take overconsumption into account
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
lenaggfile           <length aggregation file specifying lengthes; is optional and used only in weight at length likelihood>
ageaggfile           <age aggregation file specifying ages>
fleetnames           <vector of the names of the fleets>
stocknames           <vector of the names of the stocks>
```

The optional flag $<$overconsumption$>$ is used to specify whether any
over consumption of the stock is to be taken into account when
calculating the model statistical data. If this is set to 1, then the
model catch data will be adjusted to ensure that the fleets don't catch
more stock than is available, by applying a bound to the catch of the
fleets. If this line is not specified, then an overconsumption of 0 is
assumed and any understocking that is present in the model is ignored,
which can lead to an unrealistic result if the understocking likelihood
component is not specified.


The $<$fleetnames$>$ vector contains a list of all the fleets to be
aggregated into a single pseudo fleet for the purposes of the data
comparison. Similarly, the $<$stocknames$>$ vector contains a list of
all the stocks to be aggregated into a single pseudo stock.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled statistical data to the input statistical data.
Currently, there are 5 likelihood functions defined, and the format of
the statistical data given in the file specified by $<$datafile$>$
depends on the likelihood function used. The valid functions are:


* `lengthcalcstddev` - use a weighted sum of squares of mean length
* `lengthgivenstddev` - use a weighted sum of squares of mean length with given standard deviation 
* `weightgivenstddev` - use a weighted sum of squares of mean weight with given standard deviation 
* `weightnostddev` - use a unweighted sum of squares of mean weight 
* `lengthnostddev` - use a unweighted sum of squares of mean length 
* `weightgivenstddevlen` - use a weighted sum of squares of mean weight at length with given standard deviation 
* `weightnostddevlen` - use a unweighted sum of squares of mean weight at length

### Weighted Sum of Squares of Mean Length

StockDistribution {#sec-stockdist}
-----------------

The StockDistribution likelihood component is used to compare
distribution data sampled from the model with distribution data sampled
from landings or surveys for different stocks within the Gadget model.
This is typically used to compare Gadget stocks that are based on the
same species, but have differing biological properties (eg. immature and
mature fish). The distribution data can either be aggregated into age
groups (giving a distribution of length groups for each age), length
groups (giving a distribution of age groups for each length) or into
age-length groups. The likelihood score that is calculated gives some
measure as to how well the data from the model fits to the data from the
landings.


To specify a StockDistribution likelihood component, the format required
in the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 stockdistribution
datafile             <name for the datafile>
function             <function name>
aggregationlevel     <0 or 1> ; 1 to aggregate data over the whole year
overconsumption      <0 or 1> ; 1 to take overconsumption into account
epsilon              <epsilon>
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
ageaggfile           <age aggregation file specifying ages>
lenaggfile           <length aggregation file specifying lengths>
fleetnames           <vector of the names of the fleets>
stocknames           <vector of the names of the stocks>
```

The optional flag $<$aggregationlevel$>$ is used to specify whether the
distribution data should be aggregated over the whole year (by setting
aggregation level to 1) or not aggregated, and calculated for each
timestep (by setting aggregation level to 0). If this line is not
specified, then an aggregation level of 0 is assumed, and the
distribution data is not aggregated over the whole year. Note that not
all of the functions used to compare the data can aggregate the data
over the whole year.


The optional flag $<$overconsumption$>$ is used to specify whether any
over consumption of the stock is to be taken into account when
calculating the model distribution. If this is set to 1, then the model
catch data will be adjusted to ensure that the fleets don't catch more
stock than is available, by applying a bound to the catch of the fleets.
If this line is not specified, then an overconsumption of 0 is assumed
and any understocking that is present in the model is ignored, which can
lead to an unrealistic result if the understocking likelihood component
is not specified.


The optional $<$epsilon$>$ value is used whenever the calculated
probability is very unlikely, although the exact format of this depends
on the function that is to be used when calculating the likelihood
score. This means that the likelihood component is not dominated by one
or two stray values, since these will be reset back to less unlikely
values. The default value for $<$epsilon$>$ is 10, which is used
whenever it is not defined in the input file.


The $<$fleetnames$>$ vector contains a list of all the fleets to be
aggregated into a single pseudo fleet for the purposes of the data
comparison. However, the $<$stocknames$>$ vector contains a list of all
the stocks to be compared for the data comparison. These stocks are not
aggregated into a single pseudo stock.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled age-length stock distribution to the input
age-length stock distribution. Currently, there are two likelihood
functions defined, and the valid functions are:

* `sumofsquares` - use a sum of squares function 
* `multinomial` - use a multinomial function


Finally, the datafile is a list of the age-length catch distribution for
each stock, that Gadget is to use to fit the likelihood function to,
aggregated according to the aggregation files specified, for the numbers
calculated in the model. The format of this file is given below:

```
<year>  <step>  <area>  <stock>  <age>  <length>  <number>
```

where $<$number$>$ is the number of samples for the
timestep/area/stock/age/length combination.

### Sum of Squares Function

The sum of squares function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:stockdist2) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:stockdist2)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths}\sum_{\it stocks} \Big( \frac{N_{trals}}{N_{tr}} - \frac{\nu_{trals}}{\nu_{tr}}  \Big) ^2\end{equation}

where: $< N_{trals} >$ is the data sample size for that time/area/age/length/stock
combination $< \nu_{trals} >$ is the model sample size for that time/area/age/length/stock
combination. $< N_{tr} >$ and $< \nu_{tr} >$ is the total data and model
sample size for that time/area combination respectively.

### Multinomial Function

The multinomial function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:stockdist1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:stockdist1)
\ell = 2 \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \Bigg( \log N_{tral}! - \sum_{\it stocks} \log N_{trals}! + \sum_{\it stocks} \Big( N_{trals} \log {\frac{\nu_{tral}}{\sum \nu_{trals}}} \Big)\Bigg)\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the data sample size for that
time/area/age/length/stock combination $<\nu>$ is the model sample size
for that time/area/age/length/stock combination

SurveyIndices {#sec-surveyindices}
-------------

The SurveyIndices likelihood component is used to compare the
development of a stock in the Gadget model to indices calculated from a
standardized survey for that stock. These indices can be aggregated into
length groups or age groups. The likelihood component that is used is
the sum of squares of a linear regression fitted to the difference
between the modelled data and the specified index, given by
equation \@ref(eq:surveyindex) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:surveyindex)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\Big(I_{t} - (\alpha + \beta N_{t})\Big)^2\end{equation}

where: $<$ I $>$ is the observed survey index $<$ N $>$ is the
corresponding index calculated in the Gadget model


The exact format of this linear regression equation will vary, depending
on survey index data available. It is possible to take the log of the
indices and the modelled data before fitting the linear regression line.
The slope and intercept of the linear regression line are controlled by
the parameters alpha and beta, and it is possible to fix these to
specified numbers, or let Gadget calculate these to get the best fit to
the modelled data.


To specify a SurveyIndices likelihood component, the format required in
the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 surveyindices
datafile             <name for the datafile>
sitype               <survey index type>
biomass              <0 or 1> ; 1 to base index data on biomass
<survey index data>
```

The optional flag $<$biomass$>$ is used to specify whether the index
data should be based on the biomass of the stock or on the population
numbers for the stock. If this is set to 1, then the index data
calculated in the model will be based on the available biomass of the
stock. If this line is not specified, then a biomass value of 0 is
assumed and the index data calculated in the model will be based on the
available population numbers for the stock.


The format of the survey index data, and the contents of the datafile,
depend on the type of survey index that is to be used, which is
specified by the value of $<$survey index type$>$. There are currently 5
valid options, which are:


* `lengths` - defining a length group based survey index 
* `ages` - defining an age group based survey index 
* `fleets` - defining a length group based survey index, taking the fleet selectivity into account 
* `acoustic` - defining an acoustic based survey index 
* `effort` - defining an fishing effort based survey index

format of this file is given below:

```

```

where $<$number$>$ is the survey index for that timestep/area/length
combination.


The $<$fit type$>$ defines the type of linear regression equation to be
used to calculate the likelihood score for this likelihood component.
These options specify whether or not the log of the numbers is to be
used, and whether the parameters alpha and beta are to be estimated by
Gadget, or fixed. If these parameters are to be fixed, then they are
specified here. In total, there are 8 valid entries for $<$fit type$>$,
and the associated parameters, and these are:


* `linearfit`

SurveyDistribution {#sec-surveydistribution}
------------------

The SurveyDistribution likelihood component is used to compare the
development of a stock in the Gadget model to age-length indices
calculated from a survey for that stock. The likelihood score that is
calculated gives some measure as to how well the data from the model
fits to the data from the calculated survey index distribution.


To specify a SurveyDistribution likelihood component, the format
required in the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 surveydistribution
datafile             <name for the datafile>
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>

fittype              <fit type>
parameters           <fit type parameters>
<suitability parameters>
epsilon              <epsilon>
likelihoodtype       <likelihood type>
```

The $<$stocknames$>$ vector contains a list of all the stocks to be
aggregated into a single pseudo stock for the purposes of the data
comparison. The $<$suitability parameters$>$ define the suitability of
the survey fleet that was used to collect the survey index data. This is
the same format as the suitability functions for the stock, as discussed
in section \@ref(sec-suitability) above. Note that only one set of
suitability values is defined, which will be applied to all the stocks
for this likelihood component.


The $<$fit type$>$ defines what function is to be used to calculate the
survey index distribution from the modelled population. Currently, there
are two functions defined, and the valid function names are:


* `linearfit` - use a linear function 
* `powerfit` - use a power function


The $<$fit type parameters$>$ is a vector of 2 parameters that are used
to calculate the survey index values from the modelled population. The
$<$epsilon$>$ value is used whenever the calculated probability is very
unlikely, although the exact format of this depends on the likelihood
type that is to be used when calculating the likelihood score.


The $<$likelihood type$>$ defines what function is to be used to compare
the modelled survey index distribution to the input survey index
distribution. Currently, there are 4 functions defined, and the valid
function names are:


* `multinomial` - use a multinomial function 
* `pearson` - use a Pearson function
* `gamma` - use a gamma function 
* `log` - use a log function


Finally, the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ contains a list of the
age-length survey indices that Gadget is to use to fit the likelihood
function to, aggregated according to the aggregation files specified,
for the numbers calculated in the model. The format of this file is
given below:

```
<year>  <step>  <area>  <age>  <length>  <number>
```

where $<$number$>$ is the survey index for the timestep/area/age/length
combination.

### Linear Fit

The linear fit function calculates the survey index for the modelled
population from
equation \@ref(eq:surveydistfit1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:surveydistfit1)
\widehat{I}_{tral} = q_{0} S_{l} \big( N_{tral} + q_{1} \big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ S $>$ is the calculated suitability value for that length

where: $<$ S $>$ is the calculated suitability value for that length
group $<$ N $>$ is the model population for that time/area/age/length
combination

### Multinomial Function

The multinomial function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:surveydist1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:surveydist1)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \bigg( \log \big(\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \widehat{I}_{tral} \big) - {\frac { \displaystyle \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \big(\widehat{I}_{tral} \log (I_{tral} + \epsilon) \big)} { \displaystyle \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} I_{tral}} } \bigg)\end{equation}

where: $<$ I $>$ is the data survey index for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\widehat{I}>$ is the model survey index for that
time/area/age/length combination

### Pearson Function

The Pearson function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:surveydist2) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:surveydist2)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big( {\frac{ ( I_{tral} - \widehat{I}_{tral} ) ^2} {\widehat{I}_{tral} + \epsilon}} \Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ I $>$ is the data survey index for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\widehat{I}>$ is the model survey index for that
time/area/age/length combination

### Gamma Function

The gamma function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:surveydist3) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:surveydist3)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big( {\frac{ I_{tral}} { (\widehat{I}_{tral} + \epsilon )} + \log ({\widehat{I}_{tral} + \epsilon}}) \Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ I $>$ is the data survey index for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\widehat{I}>$ is the model survey index for that
time/area/age/length combination

### Log Function

The log function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:surveydist4) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:surveydist4)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \Big(  \log \Big( {\frac{ \displaystyle \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths}  \widehat{I}_{tral}} { \displaystyle \sum_{\it ages}\sum_{\it lengths} I_{tral}}} \Big) \Big) ^2\end{equation}

where: $<$ I $>$ is the data survey index for that time/area/age/length
combination $<\widehat{I}>$ is the model survey index for that
time/area/age/length combination

StomachContent {#sec-stomach}
--------------

The StomachContent likelihood component is used to compare consumption
data sampled from the model with stomach content data obtained by
analysing the stomach contents of various predators. This data can be
used to give an indication of the diet composition of the stock. The
likelihood score that is calculated gives some measure as to how well
the consumption data from the model fits to the data from the stomach
contents. Care is needed when making this comparison, since the data
will give information on the stomach content at the time of capture of
the predator, where as the Gadget simulation can only give information
about the modelled consumption of the prey by the predator.


To specify a StomachContent likelihood component, the format required in
the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 stomachcontent
function             <function name>
datafile             <name for the datafile>
epsilon              <epsilon>
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
predatornames        <vector of the names of the predators>
predatorlengths
lenaggfile           <length aggregation file specifying predator lengths>
preyaggfile          <prey aggregation file specifying preys>
```

The optional $<$epsilon$>$ value is used whenever the calculated
probability is very unlikely, although the exact format of this depends
on the function that is to be used when calculating the likelihood
score. This means that the likelihood component is not dominated by one
or two stray values, since these will be reset back to less unlikely
values. The default value for $<$epsilon$>$ is 10, which is used
whenever it is not defined in the input file.


The $<$predatornames$>$ vector contains a list of all the predators to
be aggregated into a single pseudo predator for the purposes of the data
comparison.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled consumption data to the input stomach content
data. Currently, there is only one likelihood function defined, so the
valid function name is:


* `scsimple` - use a simple ratio function


Finally, the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ contains a list of the
stomach content data that Gadget is to use to fit the likelihood
function to, aggregated according to the aggregation files specified,
for the consumption calculated in the model. The format of this file is
given below:

```
<year>  <step>  <area>  <predator>  <prey>  <ratio>
```

where $<$ratio$>$ is the ratio of prey $<$prey$>$ in the stomachs of
predator $<$predator$>$ for the timestep/area combination, where
$<$prey$>$ is defined in the prey aggregation file, and $<$predator$>$
is defined in the predator length aggregation file.

### SCSimple Function

The scsimple function calculates the likelihood component by comparing
the ratio of the consumption of different preys by a predator in the
model to the ratio of the preys found in the stomach contents data
specified in the input file, as shown in
equation \@ref(eq:stomach1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:stomach1)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it predators}\sum_{\it preys} \Big( P_{trpp} - \pi_{trpp} \Big) ^2\end{equation}

where: $<$ P $>$ is the ratio of the stomach content data for that
time/area/predator/prey combination $<\pi>$ is the ratio of the modelled
consumption for that time/area/predator/prey combination

Recaptures {#sec-recaptures}
----------

The Recaptures likelihood component is used to compare recaptures data
from tagging experiments within the model with recaptures data obtained
from tagging experiments, aggregated according to length at recapture.
The likelihood score that is calculated gives some measure as to how
well the data from the model fits the recaptures data.


To specify a Recaptures likelihood component, the format required in the
main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 recaptures
datafile             <name for the datafile>
function             <function name>
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
lenaggfile           <length aggregation file specifying recapture lengths>
fleetnames           <vector of the names of the fleets>
```

The $<$fleetnames$>$ vector contains a list of all the fleets to be
aggregated into a single pseudo fleet for the purposes of the data
comparison.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled recaptures data to the input recaptures data.
Currently, there is only one likelihood function defined, so the only
valid function name is:


* `poisson` - use a Poisson function


Finally, the datafile is a list of the recaptures that Gadget is to use
to fit the likelihood function to, aggregated according to the
aggregation files specified, for the numbers calculated in the model.
The format of this file is given below:

```
<tagid>  <year>  <step>  <area>  <length>  <number>
```

where $<$number$>$ is the number of recaptures for the
tag/timestep/area/length combination.

### Poisson Function

The Poisson function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:recap1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:recap1)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it lengths} \Big( N_{trl} + \log \nu_{trl}! - N_{trl} \log \nu_{trl} \Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the number of observed recaptures for that
time/area/length combination $<\nu>$ is the number of modelled
recaptures for that time/area/length combination

RecStatistics {#sec-recstat}
-------------

The RecStatistics likelihood component is used to compare statistical
data sampled from tagged subpopulations within the model with
statistical data obtained from the fish returned from tagging
experiments. This is used to compare biological data, such as the mean
length at age, and is similar to the CatchStatistics likelihood
component (see section \@ref(sec-catchstat)). The likelihood score that is calculated
gives some measure as to how well the data from the model fits to the
data from the recaptures.


To specify a RecStatistics likelihood component, the format required in
the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 recstatistics
datafile             <name for the datafile>
function             <function name>
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
fleetnames           <vector of the names of the fleets>
```

The $<$fleetnames$>$ vector contains a list of all the fleets to be
aggregated into a single pseudo fleet for the purposes of the data
comparison.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled statistical data to the input statistical data.
Currently, there are three likelihood functions defined, and the format
of the statistical data given in the file specified by $<$datafile$>$
depends on the likelihood function used. The valid functions are:


* `lengthcalcstddev` - use a weighted sum of squares of mean length
* `lengthgivenstddev` - use a weighted sum of squares of mean length with given standard deviation 
* `lengthnostddev` - use a unweighted sum of squares of mean length

### Weighted Sum of Squares of Mean Length

This likelihood function calculates the likelihood score based on a
weighted sum of squares of the mean length, with the weighting given by
calculating the variance of length of the modelled population, as shown
in equation \@ref(eq:recstat1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:recstat1)
\ell = \sum_{\it tags}\sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \Big(\frac{(x-\mu)^2} {\sigma^2} N\Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ x $>$ is the sample mean length from the data $<\mu>$ is the
mean length calculated from the model $<\sigma>$ is the standard
deviation of the length, calculated from the model $<$ N $>$ is the
sample size


For this RecStatistics function, the format of the statistical data
required in the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ is given below:

```
<tagid>  <year>  <step>  <area>  <number>  <mean>
```

where $<$number$>$ is the number of samples for the tag/timestep/area
combination, and $<$mean$>$ is the mean length of these samples.

### Weighted Sum of Squares of Mean LengthWith Given Standard Deviation

This likelihood function calculates the likelihood score based on a
weighted sum of squares of the mean length, with the weighting given the
variance of length of the input population, as shown in
equation \@ref(eq:recstat2) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:recstat2)
\ell = \sum_{\it tags}\sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \Big(\frac{(x-\mu)^2} {s^2} N\Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ x $>$ is the sample mean length from the data $<\mu>$ is the
mean length calculated from the model $<$ s $>$ is the standard
deviation of the length from the data $<$ N $>$ is the sample size


For this RecStatistics function, the format of the statistical data
required in the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ is given below:

```
<tagid>  <year>  <step>  <area>  <number>  <mean>  <stddev>
```

where $<$number$>$ is the number of samples for the tag/timestep/area
combination, $<$mean$>$ is the mean length of these samples and
$<$stddev$>$ is the standard deviation of the length of these samples.

### Unweighted Sum of Squares of Mean Length

This likelihood function calculates the likelihood score based on a
unweighted sum of squares of the mean length, with the variance of the
length of the population assumed to be 1, as shown in
equation \@ref(eq:recstat3) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:recstat3)
\ell = \sum_{\it tags}\sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \Big((x-\mu)^2 N\Big)\end{equation}

where: $<$ x $>$ is the sample mean length from the data $<\mu>$ is the
mean length calculated from the model $<$ N $>$ is the sample size


For this RecStatistics function, the format of the statistical data
required in the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ is given below:

```
<tagid>  <year>  <step>  <area>  <number>  <mean>
```

where $<$number$>$ is the number of samples for the tag/timestep/area
combination, and $<$mean$>$ is the mean length of these samples.

MigrationPenalty {#sec-migpenalty}
----------------

The MigrationPenalty likelihood component is used to give a penalty
whenever there is a negative migration value from the migration matrices
(which is meaningless). The MigrationPenalty component is used (rather
than the BoundLikelihood component) since the values in the migration
matrices are calculated from more than one parameter, and it is not
necessarily the individual parameters that are wrong, rather the
combination of the parameters that give the migration matrix value that
is wrong. The likelihood component that is used is based on the sum of
squares of the migration values, given by the equation below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:migpenalty)
\ell = \left( \sum_{ij}^{} M_{ij}^{p_0} \right)^{p_1}\end{equation}


The use of 2 power coefficients gives increased flexibility for the
likelihood component. In general, a higher value of $p_1$ applies a
higher penalty to "many small negative values", where as a higher value
of $p_0$ applies a higher penalty to "few large negative values". For a
simple sum of squares of the migration matrix values, $p_0$ should be
set to 2, and $p_1$ should be set to 1.


To specify a MigrationPenalty likelihood component, the format required
in the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 migrationpenalty
stockname            <name for the stock to check>
powercoeffs          <p0>  <p1>
```

Note that it is not possible to aggregate more than one stock into a
single pseudo stock for this likelihood component.

MigrationProportion {#sec-migpro}
-------------------

The MigrationProportion likelihood component is used to compare
population proportion data sampled from the model with population
proportion data sampled from landings or surveys. The populations
proportion data gives the proportion of the population is that is
present on each area on a given timestep. The likelihood score that is
calculated gives some measure as to how well the migration data from the
model fit to the data from the sample catches.


To specify a MigrationProportion likelihood component, the format
required in the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 migrationproportion
datafile             <name for the datafile>
function             <function name>
biomass              <0 or 1> ; 1 to base migration proportion data on biomass
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
stocknames           <vector of the names of the stocks>
```

The optional flag $<$biomass$>$ is used to specify whether the migration
proportion data should be based on the biomass of the stock or on the
population numbers for the stock. If this is set to 0, then the
migration proportion data calculated in the model will be based on the
available population numbers for the stock. If this line is not
specified, then a biomass value of 1 is assumed and the migration
proportion data calculated in the model will be based on the available
population biomass of the stock.


The $<$stocknames$>$ vector contains a list of all the stocks to be
aggregated into a single pseudo stock for the purposes of the data
comparison.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled migration proportion data to the input migration
proportion data. Currently, there is only one likelihood function
defined, so the valid function name is:


* `sumofsquares` - use a simple sum of squares function


Finally, the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ contains a list of the
migration proportion data that Gadget is to use to fit the likelihood
function to, aggregated according to the aggregation files specified,
for the migration proportions calculated in the model. The format of
this file is given below:

```
<year>  <step>  <area>  <ratio>
```

where $<$ratio$>$ is the proportion of stock that is in area $<$area$>$
for that timestep.

### Sum of Squares Function

The sum of squares function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:migpro1) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:migpro1)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas} \Big( P_{tr} - \pi_{tr} \Big) ^2\end{equation}

where: $<$ P $>$ is the proportion of the data sample for that time/area
combination $<\pi>$ is the proportion of the model sample for that
time/area combination

CatchInKilos {#sec-catchinkilos}
------------

The CatchInKilos likelihood component is used to compare the overall
catch from the modelled fleets with landings data. This can be done for
any fleet that has landings data available, but will give more useful
information when used with fleets of type "LinearFleet", since the
"TotalFleet" fleet type will catch the amount specified in the input
file (see section \@ref(chap-fleet) for more information on the available fleet
types).


To specify a CatchInKilos likelihood component, the format required in
the main likelihood file is as follows:

```
[component]
name                 <name for the likelihood component>
weight               <weight for the likelihood component>
type                 catchinkilos
datafile             <name for the datafile>
function             <function name>
aggregationlevel     <0 or 1> ; 1 to aggregate data over the whole year
epsilon              <epsilon>
areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
fleetnames           <vector of the names of the fleets>
stocknames           <vector of the names of the stocks>
```

The optional flag $<$aggregationlevel$>$ is used to specify whether the
catch data should be aggregated over the whole year (by setting
aggregation level to 1) or not aggregated, and calculated for each
timestep (by setting aggregation level to 0). If this line is not
specified, then an aggregation level of 0 is assumed, and the catch data
is not aggregated over the whole year.


The $<$fleetnames$>$ vector contains a list of all the fleets to be
aggregated into a single pseudo fleet for the purposes of the data
comparison. Similarly, the $<$stocknames$>$ vector contains a list of
all the stocks to be aggregated into a single pseudo stock.


The optional $<$epsilon$>$ value is used in the likelihood function to
avoid problems that would arise from taking the logarithm of zero.
Epsilon is added to both the modelled and observed landings data, to
ensure that these values are always positive, and thus should be set to
a small number. The default value for $<$epsilon$>$ is 10, which is used
whenever it is not defined in the input file.


The $<$function name$>$ defines what likelihood function is to be used
to compare the modelled catch to the input catch. Currently, there is
only one likelihood function defined, so the only valid function name
is:


* `sumofsquares` - use a log sum of squares function


Finally, the file specified by $<$datafile$>$ contains the landings data
that Gadget is to use to fit the likelihood function to for the catch
calculated in the model. The format of this file is given below:

```
<year>  <step>  <area>  <fleet>  <biomass>
```

where $<$biomass$>$ is the catch for the timestep/area/fleet
combination. The $<$step$>$ column is optional if the
$<$aggregationlevel$>$ flag has been set to 1, since the data will be
aggregated over the whole year. In this case, it is possible to specify
the landings data in the following format:

```
<year>  <area>  <fleet>  <biomass>
```

### Sum of Squares Function

The sum of squares function calculates the likelihood component from
equation \@ref(eq:catchtons) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:catchtons)
\ell = \sum_{\it time}\sum_{\it areas}\sum_{\it fleets} (\log(N_{trf} + \epsilon) - \log(\nu_{trf} + \epsilon))^2\end{equation}

where: $<$ N $>$ is the catch biomass for that time/area/fleet
combination $<\nu>$ is the modelled catch biomass for that
time/area/fleet combination

Print Files {#chap-print}
===========

The print files are used to control the output from the Gadget model
(and not the output from the optimisation process). To avoid writing the
model output from each iteration of a optimising process (and thus
generating very large files), any printfile settings are ignored if
Gadget is started with the -l switch.


To define print files in the Gadget model, the "main" file must contain
a list of the data files that contain the description of the printer
classes required, and the format for this is shown below:


    printfiles           <names of the print files>

The print files contain a list of various type of printer classes,
separated by the keyword [component], that output different
information from the model, and the name of the file that the
information is to be written to. All the output is written as a plain
ASCII text file that can be viewed in any text editor. The format of the
print file is follows:


    [component]
    type                 <printer type>
    <printer data>

The printer data for each printer type is covered in the sub sections
below. The $<$printer type$>$ defines the type of output that will be
generated from the Gadget model, and there are currently 11 valid
printer types defined in Gadget. These are:


StockStdPrinter StockFullPrinter StockPrinter PredatorPrinter
PredatorOverPrinter PreyOverPrinter StockPreyFullPrinter
StockPreyPrinter PredatorPreyPrinter LikelihoodPrinter
LikelihoodSummaryPrinter

 
StockStdPrinter {#sec-stockstdprinter}
---------------

The printer type to output the standard details of a stock is called
"StockStdPrinter". This printer type is defined by specifying the stock
and timesteps of interest. The file format for this component is given
below:


    [component]
    type                 stockstdprinter
    stockname            <name of the stock>
    scale                <scaling factor>
    printfile            <name for the output file to be created>
    precision            <precision to be used in the output file>
    printatstart         <0 or 1> ; 1 to print at start of timestep
    yearsandsteps        <ActionAtTime to determine when to print>

The optional $<$scale$>$ factor is used to scale the size of the stock,
which can be used to display the stock in terms of thousands of fish,
for example. The default value for this parameter is 1, which will
ensure that no scaling will take place.


The optional $<$precision$>$ value is used to specify the number of
digits to be used when printing the information to the specified output
file, overriding the default settings for this printer type.


The optional flag $<$printatstart$>$ is used to specify whether the
information about the stock should be printed at the start or the end of
the timestep. If this is set to 1, then the stock information as it is
at the start of the timestep is printed, before any other calculation
has taken place (see appendix \@ref(chap-order) for more information on the order of the
calculations). The default value for $<$printatstart$>$ is 0, which
means that the information at the end of the timestep is printed, and is
used whenever the flag is not specified in the input file.


The output that is generated from this printer type is a file containing
the following information for the stock specified on the $<$stockname$>$
line:


    year-step-area-age-number-length-weight-stddev-consumed-biomass

where: $<$number$>$ is the stock population for that timestep/area/age
combination $<$length$>$ is the mean length for that timestep/area/age
combination $<$weight$>$ is the mean weight for that timestep/area/age
combination $<$stddev$>$ is the standard deviation for the length for
that timestep/area/age combination $<$consumed$>$ is the stock
population that has been consumed by all the predators (including
fleets) for that timestep/area/age combination $<$biomass$>$ is the
stock biomass that has been consumed by all the predators (including
fleets) for that timestep/area/age combination

StockFullPrinter {#sec-stockfullprinter}
----------------

The printer type to output some more detailed information about a stock
is called "StockFullPrinter". This printer type is defined by specifying
the stock and timesteps of interest. The file format for this component
is given below:


    [component]
    type                 stockfullprinter
    stockname            <name of the stock>
    printfile            <name for the output file to be created>
    precision            <precision to be used in the output file>
    printatstart         <0 or 1> ; 1 to print at start of timestep
    yearsandsteps        <ActionAtTime to determine when to print>

The optional $<$precision$>$ value is used to specify the number of
digits to be used when printing the information to the specified output
file, overriding the default settings for this printer type.


The optional flag $<$printatstart$>$ is used to specify whether the
information about the stock should be printed at the start or the end of
the timestep. If this is set to 1, then the stock information as it is
at the start of the timestep is printed, before any other calculation
has taken place (see appendix \@ref(chap-order) for more information on the order of the
calculations). The default value for $<$printatstart$>$ is 0, which
means that the information at the end of the timestep is printed, and is
used whenever the flag is not specified in the input file.


The output that is generated from this printer type is a file containing
the following information for the stock specified on the $<$stockname$>$
line:


    year-step-area-age-length-number-weight

where: $<$number$>$ is the population for that timestep/area/age/length
combination $<$weight$>$ is the mean weight for that
timestep/area/age/length combination

StockPrinter {#sec-stockprinter}
------------

The printer type to output information about (one or more) stocks, with
the information aggregated into a convenient grouping, is called
"StockPrinter". This printer type is defined by specifying the stocks,
areas, age groups, length groups and timesteps of interest. The file
format for this component is given below:


    [component]
    type                 stockprinter
    stocknames           <vector of the names of the stocks>
    areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
    ageaggfile           <age aggregation file specifying ages>
    lenaggfile           <length aggregation file specifying lengths>
    printfile            <name for the output file to be created>
    precision            <precision to be used in the output file>
    printatstart         <0 or 1> ; 1 to print at start of timestep
    yearsandsteps        <ActionAtTime to determine when to print>

Note that this printer type can aggregate more than one stock into a
combined pseudo stock for the output file.


The optional $<$precision$>$ value is used to specify the number of
digits to be used when printing the information to the specified output
file, overriding the default settings for this printer type.


The optional flag $<$printatstart$>$ is used to specify whether the
information about the stock should be printed at the start or the end of
the timestep. If this is set to 1, then the stock information as it is
at the start of the timestep is printed, before any other calculation
has taken place (see appendix \@ref(chap-order) for more information on the order of the
calculations). The default value for $<$printatstart$>$ is 0, which
means that the information at the end of the timestep is printed, and is
used whenever the flag is not specified in the input file.


The output that is generated from this printer type is a file containing
the following information for all the stocks specified on the
$<$stocknames$>$ line:


    year-step-area-age-length-number-weight

where: $<$area$>$ is the label for the area from the area aggregation
file $<$age$>$ is the label for the age group from the age aggregation
file $<$length$>$ is the label for the length group from the length
aggregation file $<$number$>$ is the population for that
timestep/area/age/length combination $<$weight$>$ is the mean weight for
that timestep/area/age/length combination

PredatorPrinter {#sec-predatorprinter}

The printer type to output information about predation, with the
information aggregated into a convenient grouping, is called

    preynames            <vector of the names of the preys>
    areaaggfile          <area aggregation file specifying areas>
    predlenaggfile       <length aggregation file specifying predator lengths>

    precision            <precision to be used in the output file>
    yearsandsteps        <ActionAtTime to determine when to print>

Note that this printer type can aggregate more than one predator into a
combined pseudo predator, and more than one prey into a pseudo prey, for
the output file.


The optional flag $<$biomass$>$ is used to specify whether the
information about the consumption of the preys by the predators is
printed by biomass consumed or by number consumed. If this is set to 1
then information about the consumption is printed by biomass consumed.
If this is set to 0 then this information is printed by number consumed.
The default value for $<$biomass$>$ is 1, which means that the
consumption by biomass will be printed if this flag is not specified in
the input file.


The optional $<$precision$>$ value is used to specify the number of
digits to be used when printing the information to the specified output
file, overriding the default settings for this printer type.

file $<$pred$>$ is the label for the predator length group from the
length aggregation file $<$prey$>$ is the label for the prey length
group from the length aggregation file $<$amount$>$ is the biomass (or

The printer type to output information about prey over consumption
(where there has been insufficient prey for a predator to consume), with
the information aggregated into a convenient grouping, is called
"PreyOverPrinter". This printer type is the inverse of the
PredatorOverPrinter printer type, in that it gives the same information,
but from the point of view of the preys, not the predators. This printer
type is defined by specifying the preys, areas, length groups and
timesteps of interest. The file format for this component is given

LikelihoodPrinter {#sec-likelihoodprinter}

format for this component is given below:


    [component]
    type                 likelihoodprinter
    likelihood           <name of the likelihood component>
    printfile            <name for the output file to be created>

The output that is generated from this printer type is a file containing
the internal model information for the likelihood component specified on

LikelihoodSummaryPrinter {#sec-likelihoodsummaryprinter}

    printfile            <name for the output file to be created>

The output that is generated from this printer type is a file containing
summary information for all the likelihood components that have been
defined for the current simulation:


    year-step-area-component-weight-score

where: $<$component$>$ is the name of the likelihood component
$<$weight$>$ is the weight of the likelihood component $<$score$>$ is
the score from the likelihood component for that timestep/area
combination

Parameter File {#chap-param}
==============

The parameter file is used to specify the initial values for the
switches that are to be used in the Gadget model (see What Does The \#
Mean?, section \@ref(sec-whatdoeshash)). This file is specified by a "-i
$<$filename$>$" command line option when Gadget is started, for example,
this would take the parameter information from a file called
"inputfile.txt":


    gadget -s -i inputfile.txt

This file contains a list of all the switches, their initial value, the
lower and upper bounds and a flag to note whether the optimiser should
optimise that switch or not. The first line of this file must contain
the column headings, and then subsequent lines should list all switches
that are used. An example of this file format is shown below:


    switch  value    lower    upper    optimise
    <name>  <value>  <lower>  <upper>  <0 or 1> ; 1 to optimise this parameter

Note that if Gadget is performing a simulation run, then the "optimise"
column is still required, although the value of the optimise flag will
have no affect on the outcome of the simulation.


In some cases an initial value for a parameter is not known, or a random
starting point is wanted (for example, to ensure that the value of the
starting point has little affect on the outcome of the optimisation).
This is done by specifying the keyword "random" instead of an initial
value, which will ensure that Gadget will set the initial value for that
parameter to a random point within the bounds. This is shown in the
example below, where the initial value for the parameter "age2" will be
set to a random point between 1 and 10:


    age2    random   1        10       1 ; random value between 1 and 10

Optimisation File {#chap-optim}
=================

The optimisation file is used to specify the type of optimisation to be
used, along with any parameters that are needed for the optimisation
algorithm. This file is specified by a "-opt $<$filename$>$" command
line option when Gadget is started, for example, this would take the
optimisation information from a file called "optinfo.txt":


    gadget -l -opt optinfo.txt

There are three types of optimisation algorithms currently implemented
in Gadget - these are one based on the Hooke & Jeeves algorithm, one
based on the Simulated Annealing algorithm and one based on the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno ("BFGS") algorithm. These algorithms
are described in more detail in the following sections. Gadget can also
combine two or more of these algorithms into a single hybrid algorithm,
that should result in a more efficient search for an optimum solution.


All the optimisation techniques used by Gadget attempt to minimise the
likelihood function. That is, they look for the best set of parameters
to run the model with, in order to get the best fit according to the
likelihood functions you have specified. Thus, the optimiser is
attempting to minimize a single one-dimensional measure of fit between
the model output and the data, which can lead to unexpected results.


The optimisation process will tend to produce realistic values for the
most significant parameters (typically growth, recruitment in large year
classes and fishing selectivity) before finding realistic values for
less significant parameters. It should be noted that the parameters
governing recruitment and growth in the last few years with data in a
simulation will be among the last to settle on realistic values. It is
important to ensure that an optimum solution has been reached before
accepting the model, especially if the model is to be used to predict
the population into the future or to examine the strength of the last
few year classes.

Hooke & Jeeves {#sec-hooke}
--------------

### Overview {#subsec-hookeover}

Hooke & Jeeves is a simple and fast optimising method, but somewhat
unreliable, and it is often described as a 'hill climbing' technique.
From the initial starting point the algorithm takes a step in various
'directions', and conducts a new model run. If the new likelihood score
is better than the old one then the algorithm uses the new point as it's
best guess. If it is worse then the algorithm retains the old point. The
search proceeds in series of these steps, each step slightly smaller
than the previous one. When the algorithm finds a point which it cannot
improve on with a small step in any direction then it accepts this point
as being the 'solution', and exits. It can be seen that this renders the
scheme vulnerable to producing local solutions, accepting a local dip as
being the solution even if a better solution exists elsewhere, beyond a
local 'hill' that the algorithm cannot see past. In order to combat this
tendency it is strongly recommended that you re-run the optimisation,
using the final point of one run as the start of the next. This will
effectively re-set the searching step size to large steps, and give
Gadget a chance of escaping from local solutions. Finding the same
result twice in a row does not guarantee it is the best possible
solution, but finding different results certainly indicates that the
larger result is not the solution you are seeking.


The Hooke & Jeeves algorithm used in Gadget is derived from that
originally presented by R. Hooke and T. A. Jeeves, "Direct Search
Solution of Numerical and Statistical Problems" in the April 1961 (Vol.
8, pp. 212-229) issue of the Journal of the ACM, with improvements
presented by Arthur F Kaupe Jr., "Algorithm 178: Direct Search" in the
June 1963 (Vol 6, pp.313-314) issue of the Communications of the ACM.


Hooke & Jeeves is the default optimisation method used for Gadget, and
will be used if no optimisation information file is specified.

### File Format {#subsec-hookefile}

To specify the Hooke & Jeeves algorithm, the optimisation file should
start with the keyword "[hooke]", followed by (up to) 4 lines giving
the parameters for the optimisation algorithm. Any parameters that are
not specified in the file are given default values, which work
reasonably well for simple Gadget models. The format for this file, and
the default values for the optimisation parameters, are shown below:


    [hooke]
    hookeiter  1000  ; number of hooke & jeeves iterations
    hookeeps   1e-04 ; minimum epsilon, hooke & jeeves halt criteria
    rho        0.5   ; step length adjustment factor
    lambda     0     ; initial value for the step length

### Parameters {#subsec-hookepar}

#### hookeiter

This is the maximum number of Gadget model runs that the Hooke & Jeeves
algorithm will use to try to find the best solution. If this number is
exceeded, Gadget will select the best point found so far, and accept
this as the 'solution', even though it has not met the convergence
criteria. A warning that Gadget has stopped without finding a solution
that meets the convergence criteria will be printed.

#### hookeeps

This is the criteria for halting the Hooke & Jeeves algorithm at a
minimum, and accepting the current point as the 'solution'. The
algorithm has "converged" when the size of each step in the search has
been reduced to less than this value, and no further improvements can be
made. This means that each parameter in the Gadget model is less than
hookeeps from their value at the (local) optimum. Larger values of
hookeeps give a quicker running time, but a less accurate estimate of
the minimum. Conversely, smaller values will give a longer running time,
but a more accurate estimate of the minimum.

#### rho

This is the resizing multiplier for the step length of the search made
by the algorithm. The Hooke & Jeeves algorithm works by taking "steps"
from one estimate of a optimum, to another (hopefully better) estimate
of the optimum. Taking big steps gets to the minimum more quickly, at
the risk of 'stepping over' an excellent point. When no improvements to
the minimum can be made by taking steps of the current length, the step
length is reduced by multiplying it by rho.


Small values of rho correspond to big step length changes, which make
the algorithm run more quickly. However, there is a chance that these
big changes will accidentally overlook a promising point, leading to
non-convergence. Larger values of rho correspond to smaller step length
changes, which force the algorithm to carefully examine nearby points
instead of optimistically forging ahead, which improves the probability
of convergence. The value of rho must be between 0 and 1.

#### lambda

This is the initial value for the size of the steps in the search, which
will be used for the the first search, before any modification to the
step length. All the parameters in the Gadget model are initially scaled
so that their value is 1, and the initial search will then look at the
points $1 \pm \lambda$ for the next optimum. Setting lambda to zero will
set the initial value for the step length equal to rho. The value of
lambda must be between 0 and 1.

Simulated Annealing {#sec-simann}
-------------------

### Overview {#subsec-simannover}

Simulated Annealing is a global optimisation method that distinguishes
between different local minimum. From the initial starting point the
algorithm takes a random step in various directions, and conducts a new
model run. If the new likelihood score is better than the old one then
the algorithm uses the new point as it's best guess. If it is worse then
the algorithm may accept this point, based on the probabilistic
"Metropolis Criteria", and thus the algorithm can escape from a local
minimum. The search proceeds in series of these steps, with the point
that gives the overall lowest likelihood score is stored as a "best
point". The algorithm exits when a stable point is found which cannot be
improved on with a small step in any direction, and the Metropolis
Criteria rejects all the steps away from the current best point. The
best point is then accepted as being the 'solution'.


The Metropolis Criteria will accept a move in an uphill direction (ie. a
point with a worse likelihood score) based on a function of both the
size of the move and a parameter termed "temperature", and is given in
equation \@ref(eq:metropolis) below:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
(\#eq:metropolis)
M & = & e^{\displaystyle \frac{-\Delta F} {t}} \nonumber \\
P & = &
\begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{if $M$ > $r$} \\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{aligned}\end{equation}

where: $<\Delta F>$ is the change in likelihood score $<$ t $>$ is the
"temperature" of the algorithm $<$ r $>$ is a random number between 0
and 1


Note that when the "temperature" is very high (t $\rightarrow \infty$),
the Metropolis Criteria will always accept any 'uphill' move, and the
Simulated Annealing algorithm will simplify to a form of a random search
algorithm. Conversely, when the temperature is very low (t $\rightarrow$
0), the Metropolis Criteria will always reject any 'uphill' move, and
the Simulated Annealing algorithm will simplify to a form of a
hill-climbing algorithm, similar to Hooke & Jeeves. By slowly reducing
the temperature of the algorithm, the number of uphill moves that are
accepted are reduced and the algorithm will find a minimum.


The terminology for the Simulated Annealing algorithm comes from a
metaphor with the thermodynamic process of cooling molten metals. At
very high temperatures, the atoms in molten metals move very fast, and
slow considerably at lower temperatures. If the metal is cooled slowly
(termed "annealing"), the atoms have time to line up to form a highly
ordered, strong, crystalline structure. If the metal is cooled too
quickly ("quenching") the resulting solid will have a weaker, less
ordered, structure.


In comparison to the Hooke & Jeeves optimisation algorithm, where Hooke
& Jeeves performs a 'local' stepwise search, Simulated Annealing
searches much more widely over the surface in order to find the best
point. By doing this it is less likely than Hooke & Jeeves to be fooled
by a local minimum, and more likely to home in on the true optimum.
However the price to paid for doing this is that it can take
considerably more computer time to reach a solution.


The Simulated Annealing algorithm used in Gadget is derived from that
presented by Corana et al, "Minimising Multimodal Functions of
Continuous Variables with the 'Simulated Annealing' Algorithm" in the
September 1987 (Vol. 13, pp. 262-280) issue of the ACM Transactions on
Mathematical Software and Goffe et al, "Global Optimisation of
Statistical Functions with Simulated Annealing" in the January/February
1994 (Vol. 60, pp. 65-100) issue of the Journal of Econometrics.

### File Format {#subsec-simannfile}

To specify the Simulated Annealing algorithm, the optimisation file
should start with the keyword "[simann]", followed by (up to) 11 lines
giving the parameters for the optimisation algorithm. Any parameters
that are not specified in the file are given default values, which work
reasonably well for simple Gadget models. The format for this file, and
the default values for the optimisation parameters, are shown below:


    [simann]
    simanniter 2000  ; number of simulated annealing iterations
    simanneps  1e-04 ; minimum epsilon, simann halt criteria
    t          100   ; simulated annealing initial temperature
    rt         0.85  ; temperature reduction factor
    nt         2     ; number of loops before temperature adjusted
    ns         5     ; number of loops before step length adjusted
    vm         1     ; initial value for the maximum step length
    cstep      2     ; step length adjustment factor
    lratio     0.3   ; lower limit for ratio when adjusting step length
    uratio     0.7   ; upper limit for ratio when adjusting step length
    check      4     ; number of temperature loops to check

### Parameters {#subsec-simannpar}

#### simanniter

This is the maximum number of Gadget model runs that the Simulated
Annealing algorithm will use to try to find the best solution. If this
number is exceeded, Gadget will select the best point found so far, and
accept this as the 'solution', even though it has not met the
convergence criteria. A warning that Gadget has stopped without finding
a solution that meets the convergence criteria will be printed.

#### simanneps

This is the criteria for halting the Simulated Annealing algorithm at a
minimum, and accepting the current point as the 'solution'. The
algorithm has "converged" if the point found at the end of a temperature
loop is within simanneps of the best point, and is also within simanneps
of the point found at the end of the last 'check' temperature loops.
This will mean that during each of the last 'check' temperature loops,
the accepted point has moved less than simanneps away from the overall
best point, showing that the best point found so far is stable. Lower
values for simanneps will give a more stable estimate of the minimum, at
the cost of a longer running time. Note that the convergence criteria is
only checked at the end of each temperature loop.

#### t

This is the initial value for the "temperature" of the Simulated
Annealing algorithm, used to control the speed of the convergence of the
algorithm, using the Metropolis Criteria given in
equation \@ref(eq:metropolis) above. High values for the temperature (t
$\gg \Delta F$) will mean that most of the uphill moves are accepted,
and the algorithm will be performing a random search, which is
computationally very intensive. Low values for the temperature (t
$\ll \Delta F$) will mean that most of the uphill moves are rejected and
the algorithm will be performing an inefficient local search.

#### rt

This is the temperature reduction factor, used to lower the temperature
of the algorithm as it moves closer to the minimum. Higher values here
will mean that the temperature is reduced slowly, which will mean that
the algorithm is will examine the search area more thoroughly, leading
to better convergence at a cost of much higher computational time. Lower
values of rt will mean that the temperature is reduced quickly, leading
to faster convergence, possibly to a local minimum that the algorithm
cannot escape from (this is analogous to "quenching" in the
thermodynamic metaphor). The value of rt must be between 0 and 1.

#### nt

This is the number of loops that the algorithm will perform before
reducing the temperature parameter. Higher values here will mean that
the algorithm will explore the current search area more thoroughly,
improving the chance of finding a global minimum, at the cost of
considerably higher computational time. Conversely, lower values will
mean that the current search area is not explored as thoroughly, with a
corresponding reduction in computation time. Note that each temperature
loop consists of all of the "ns" step loops.

#### ns

This is the number of loops that the algorithm will perform before
adjusting the maximum step length parameter. The maximum step length is
periodically adjusted so that approximately half of all moves are
accepted, since too many, or too few, accepted moves is a waste of
computational effort.


When the algorithm adjusts the maximum step length, the ratio of
accepted moves to rejected moves since the last adjustment of the
maximum step length is taken into account. If more moves are accepted
than rejected, the maximum step length will fall and so the search will
focus on the most promising area. However, if more moves are rejected
that accepted, the maximum step length will rise so the search area will
widen.

#### vm

This is the initial maximum step length for the Simulated Annealing
algorithm. The maximum step length will get adjusted during the
optimisation process. Note that each of the steps taken by the Simulated
Annealing algorithm are not uniform, and will have a random length of
between zero and the maximum step length.


It is important to note that unlike the Hooke & Jeeves algorithm, the
parameters are not scaled during the optimisation process, and so the
maximum step length should be selected so that the initial search area
will cover the area of interest. For efficient use of the Simulated
Annealing algorithm, it is recommended that the parameters to be
estimated are scaled (by the user) so that they are all approximately
the same order of magnitude.

#### cstep, lratio and uratio

These parameters control how the maximum step length for the Simulated
Annealing algorithm is adjusted, at the end of each of the "ns" step
loops. The algorithm keeps track of the number of moves that are
accepted and rejected for each direction, and then adjusts the value of
the maximum step length for each direction so that the ratio of accepted
to rejected moves is approximately 50:50. The maximum step length for
each direction is adjusted according to
equation \@ref(eq:vm)
below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:vm)
vm_{i} =
\begin{cases}
vm_{i} * (1 + \frac{C (R_{i} - U)}{L}) & \textrm{if $R_{i} > U$} \\
vm_{i} / (1 + \frac{C (L - R_{i})}{L}) & \textrm{if $R_{i} < L$} \\
vm_{i} & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{equation}

where: $< R_{i} >$ is the ratio of accepted moves for direction i $<$ C
$>$ is the value of the "cstep" parameter $<$ U $>$ is the value of the
"uratio" parameter $<$ L $>$ is the value of the "lratio" parameter

#### check

This is the number of temperature loops that the Simulated Annealing
algorithm will check to confirm that the current best point that has
been found is a stable minimum, so that it can be accepted as a
solution.

BFGS {#sec-bfgs}
----

### Overview {#subsec-bfgsover}

BFGS is a quasi-Newton optimisation method that uses information about
the gradient of the function at the current point to calculate the best
direction to look in to find a better point. Using this information, the
BFGS algorithm can iteratively calculate a better approximation to the
inverse Hessian matrix, which will lead to a better approximation of the
minimum value.


From an initial starting point, the gradient of the function is
calculated and then the algorithm uses this information to calculate the
best direction to perform a linesearch for a point that is "sufficiently
better". The linesearch that is used in Gadget to look for a better
point in this direction is the "Armijo" linesearch. The algorithm will
then adjust the current estimate of the inverse Hessian matrix, and
restart from this new point. If a better point cannot be found, then the
inverse Hessian matrix is reset and the algorithm restarts from the last
accepted point.


For a point at a stable minimum, the magnitude of the gradient vector
will be zero, since there is no direction that the algorithm can move in
to find a better local point. However, finding such a point using an
iterative process can take an infinite number of steps, so the algorithm
exits when the magnitude of the gradient vector is less than a small
number. The current point is then accepted as being the 'solution'.


The "Armijo" linesearch calculates the stepsize that is to be used to
move to a point that is "sufficiently better", along the search
direction vector calculated from the gradient, to be $\beta^n$, where n
is the first integer that satisfies the Armijo rule given by
inequality\@ref(eq:armijo) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:armijo)
f(x) - f(x + \beta^{n}d) \geq - \sigma \beta^{n}d \nabla f(x) ^{T}\end{equation}

where: $<\nabla f(x)>$ is the gradient of the function at the current
point $<$ d $>$ is the search direction vector


In comparison to the other optimising algorithms that are currently
implemented in Gadget, BFGS performs a local search, and so it doesn't
cover the wide search area that the Simulated Annealing algorithm can
use to look for an optimum. BFGS will usually take more computer time to
find an optimum than the Hooke & Jeeves algorithm, since numerically
calculating the gradient of the function is computationally very
intensive. However, the optimum found by the BFGS algorithm will usually
be better than that found by the Hooke & Jeeves algorithm, since a
gradient search method is usually more accurate than a stepwise search
method.


The BFGS algorithm used in Gadget is derived from that presented by
Dimitri P Bertsekas, "Nonlinear Programming" ($2^{nd}$ edition, pp22-61)
published by Athena Scientific. The forward difference gradient
algorithm used to calculate the gradient is derived from that presented
by Dennis and Schnabel, "Numerical Methods for Unconstrained
Optimisation and Nonlinear Equations" ("Classics" edition, published by
SIAM).

### File Format {#subsec-bfgsfile}

To specify the BFGS algorithm, the optimisation file should start with
the keyword "[bfgs]", followed by (up to) 7 lines giving the
parameters for the optimisation algorithm. Any parameters that are not
specified in the file are given default values, which work reasonably
well for simple Gadget models. The format for this file, and the default
values for the optimisation parameters, are shown below:


    [bfgs]
    bfgsiter   10000 ; number of bfgs iterations
    bfgseps    0.01  ; minimum epsilon, bfgs halt criteria
    sigma      0.01  ; armijo convergence criteria
    beta       0.3   ; armijo adjustment factor
    gradacc    1e-06 ; initial value for gradient accuracy
    gradstep   0.5   ; gradient accuracy adjustment factor
    gradeps    1e-10 ; minimum value for gradient accuracy

### Parameters {#subsec-bfgspar}

#### bfgsiter

This is the maximum number of Gadget model runs that the BFGS algorithm
will use to try to find the best solution. If this number is exceeded,
Gadget will select the best point found so far, and accept this as the
'solution', even though it has not met the convergence criteria. A
warning that Gadget has stopped without finding a solution that meets
the convergence criteria will be printed.

#### bfgseps

This is the criteria for halting the BFGS algorithm at a minimum, and
accepting the current point as the 'solution'. The algorithm has
"converged" if the magnitude of the gradient vector is less than
bfgseps. Lower values of bfgseps will give a better estimate of the
minimum, at the cost of a considerably increased running time. At the
true minimum, the magnitude of the gradient vector will be zero, since
there would be no direction for the algorithm to move to, but this point
could take an infinite number of iterations to find.

#### sigma

This is the criteria for stopping the Armijo linesearch at a point that
is "sufficiently better", and recalculating the gradient of the function
at this new point. Lower values of sigma will increase the size of the
acceptance region of the Armijo linesearch (by relaxing the condition
for the inequality, see
equation \@ref(eq:armijo) above), which will mean that the linesearch will
stop earlier, leading to larger steps by the BFGS algorithm. Conversely,
higher values of sigma will decrease the size of the acceptance region,
which will mean that the BFGS algorithm will take smaller steps. The
value of sigma must be between 0 and 1, and should be close to zero.

#### beta

This is the adjustment factor for the Armijo linesearch, used to
calculate the size of the step taken by the linesearch to find the next
point. Lower values of beta will mean that the size of the step that the
algorithm tries to take in the direction of the gradient vector is
smaller, but the step is more likely to be in the acceptance region.
Conversely, higher values of beta will result in larger steps being
tried, but these steps are more likely to be rejected since they may be
outside the acceptance region. The value of beta must be between 0 and
1.

#### gradacc, gradstep and gradeps

These parameters control the accuracy that is used for the gradient
calculations. The gradient of the function is calculated numerically by
Gadget using a forward difference algorithm, as shown in
equation \@ref(eq:grad) below:

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:grad)
\nabla f(x) \approx \frac{f(x + \delta x) - f(x)} {\delta x}\end{equation}

where: $<\delta>$ is the value of the "gradacc" parameter


When the BFGS algorithm is reset (that is, if the Armijo linesearch
fails to find a better point) the gradient accuracy parameter is made
smaller to increase the level of accuracy that is used in the gradient
calculations. This is done by multiplying the gradacc parameter by the
gradstep parameter, which is a simple reduction factor (and as such must
be between 0 and 1). To prevent the gradacc parameter getting too small,
the BFGS algorithm will stop once the value of gradacc is less that the
value of gradeps. Both gradacc and gradeps must be between 0 and 1, with
gradeps smaller than gradacc, and the gradient calculations are more
accurate when the gradacc parameter is very small.

Combining Optimisation Algorithms {#sec-combine}
---------------------------------

### Overview {#subsec-combineover}

This method attempts to combine the global search of the Simulated
Annealing algorithm and the more rapid convergence of the local searches
performed by the Hooke & Jeeves and BFGS algorithms. It relies on the
observation that the likelihood function for many Gadget models consists
of a large 'valley' in which the best solution lies, surrounded by much
more 'rugged' terrain.


A period of Simulated Annealing at the start of the optimisation run
serves to move the search into this valley, at which point the Simulated
Annealing algorithm becomes inefficient so the Hooke & Jeeves algorithm
and/or the BFGS algorithm takes over and homes in on a solution within
that valley. Hopefully the Simulated Annealing algorithm will have moved
the current point to the correct side of any 'hills' to avoid the local
searches becoming trapped into an unrealistic local minimum.

### File Format {#subsec-combinefile}

To specify a combination of optimisation algorithms, the optimisation
file should simply list the algorithms that should be used, along with
the parameters for each optimisation algorithm. Any parameters that are
not specified in the file are given default values, which work
reasonably well for simple Gadget models. As an example, the format for
this file used to specify all three optimisation algorithms, and the
default values for the optimisation parameters, is shown below:


    [simann]
    simanniter 2000  ; number of simulated annealing iterations
    simanneps  1e-04 ; minimum epsilon, simann halt criteria
    t          100   ; simulated annealing initial temperature
    rt         0.85  ; temperature reduction factor
    nt         2     ; number of loops before temperature adjusted
    ns         5     ; number of loops before step length adjusted
    vm         1     ; initial value for the maximum step length
    cstep      2     ; step length adjustment factor
    lratio     0.3   ; lower limit for ratio when adjusting step length
    uratio     0.7   ; upper limit for ratio when adjusting step length
    check      4     ; number of temperature loops to check
    [hooke]
    hookeiter  1000  ; number of hooke & jeeves iterations
    hookeeps   1e-04 ; minimum epsilon, hooke & jeeves halt criteria
    rho        0.5   ; step length adjustment factor
    lambda     0     ; initial value for the step length
    [bfgs]
    bfgsiter   10000 ; number of bfgs iterations
    bfgseps    0.01  ; minimum epsilon, bfgs halt criteria
    sigma      0.01  ; armijo convergence criteria
    beta       0.3   ; armijo adjustment factor
    gradacc    1e-06 ; initial value for gradient accuracy
    gradstep   0.5   ; gradient accuracy adjustment factor
    gradeps    1e-10 ; minimum value for gradient accuracy

It should be noted that the optimisation algorithms will be performed in
the order that they are specified in the input file, so for this example
the order will be: first Simulated Annealing, second Hooke & Jeeves and
finally BFGS.

### Parameters {#subsec-combinepar}

The parameters for this combined optimisation algorithm are the same as
for the individual algorithms, and are described in sections
[11.1.3](#subsec:hookepar){reference-type="ref"
reference="subsec:hookepar"} (for the Hooke & Jeeves parameters),
[11.2.3](#subsec:simannpar){reference-type="ref"
reference="subsec:simannpar"} (for the Simulated Annealing parameters)
and [11.3.3](#subsec:bfgspar){reference-type="ref"
reference="subsec:bfgspar"} (for the BFGS parameters).

Repeatability {#sec-repeat}
-------------

The optimisation algorithms used by Gadget contain a random number
generator, used to randomise the order of the parameters (to ensure that
the order of the parameters has no effect on the optimum found) and to
generate the initial direction chosen by the algorithm to look for a
solution. For the Simulated Annealing algorithm, this is also affects
the Metropolis criteria used to accept any changes in an 'uphill'
direction.


The use of a random number generator means that it is unlikely that two
optimising runs will produce exactly the same 'optimum', even if they
start from the same point (although it is hoped that the optima would be
very similar if a stable starting point was chosen). This causes a
problem with repeatability, since there is no guarantee that an
optimising run can be repeated. However, it is possible to 'seed' the
random number generator with an integer to avoid this problem. To
specify a seed for the random number generator, an extra line must be
added to the optimisation file, as shown below:


    seed       n     ; seed the random number generator with n

It is also possible to specify the value that is used to seed the random
number generator from the command line, by starting Gadget with the
"-seed \<number\>" switch. It should be noted that any value for the
seed that is specified in the optimisation file will override the value
that is specified as a command line option.

Output Files {#chap-output}
============

The model output files contain information about the optimisation
process (and not information about the stocks in the model - see the
section on the Print Files,
section \@ref(chap-print),
for information on these). The output files are specified by some of the
commandline parameters used to start Gadget. There are three types of
output file.

Parameter Output {#sec-paramoutput}
----------------

The parameter output file is automatically generated by Gadget every
time that Gadget is run. If Gadget is not started with the "-p
$<$filename$>$" option, this file will be called "params.out". This file
contains information about the values of the switches at the end of the
Gadget run, in the same format as for the column output file. In the
header of this file there will be information about the Gadget run,
followed by the final overall likelihood score and the total number of
iterations. There is then the information about the switches used in the
Gadget run - the name, value, lower bound, upper bound and whether the
switch is to be optimised.


This file is written in the same format as the parameter input file, and
it can be used as the starting point for a subsequent Gadget run.

Likelihood Output {#sec-likelihoodoutput}
-----------------

The likelihood output file is generated when Gadget is started with the
"-o $<$filename$>$" option, and the output is written to the file
specified after that option, so, for example, this would write the
output to a file called "likelihood.txt":


    gadget -l -o likelihood.txt

The likelihood output file is split into three sections, separated by a
line containing a brief comment. The first section lists the names of
the switches used in the model, together with some information about
where that switch is used.


The second part of the likelihood output file contains information about
the likelihood components used in the optimisation of the model. The
names of the components are listed, along with an identifier to the type
and the weight assigned to the component.


The final part of the likelihood output file contains the output from
the optimisation process. There is a single line for each iteration of
the optimisation, containing the iteration number followed by a tab
character, then the value of each switch, followed by a gap (2 tab
characters), followed by the value of each of the likelihood components,
followed by another gap (again, 2 tab characters) followed by the
overall likelihood score for that iteration.


For a long optimisation run, this can result in this file being quite
large. The default option is for this line to be written for each
iteration, but this can be changed using the "-print $<$number$>$"
option, which will only write out this line every $<$number$>$
iterations, as shown in the example below:


    gadget -l -o likelihood.txt -print 10

which will set Gadget to write this information, to the file
"likelihood.txt", after every 10th iteration.

Log Output {#sec-logoutput}
----------

The log output file is generated when Gadget is started with the "-log
$<$filename$>$" option, and the output is written to the file specified
after that option, so, for example, this would write the output to a
file called "gadget.log":


    gadget -log gadget.log

The log file contains a listing of the actions that Gadget is
performing, as those actions are being performed - an entry can be made
whenever data is read from a file, or a likelihood score is calculated,
for example. The log file is of most use when initially setting up and
debugging a Gadget model, since it makes it easy to trace what Gadget is
doing, so, for example, the details of the last actions that were
performed before displayed a warning message are recorded.


This log file that is generated can be a large file if Gadget is
performing an optimising run. It is possible to control the amount of
information that is written to the log file using the "-loglevel
$<$number$>$" command line option. The valid values for the loglevel
number, and the associated meanings, are given in the list below:


  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   **loglevel**  **meaning**
        0        no output, only used in conjunction with the Paramin optimiser
        1        output informational messages only (cannot be set from the command line)
        2        also output error messages (default value for an optimising run)
        3        also output warning messages (default value for a simulation run)
        4        also output debug messages (only useful when debugging Gadget code)
        5        also output detailed messages (default value if a log file is specified)
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------


Examples of valid loglevel values include:

1.  specifying a log file (called "gadget.log") for an optimising run
    that only includes informational and error messages (and not the
    more detailed messages that would be written to the log file by
    default)

    
        gadget -l -log gadget.log -loglevel 2

2.  specifying a log file for a simulation run that includes error and
    warning messages (note that it is not possible to disable the
    warning messages during a simulation run)

    
        gadget -s -log gadget.log -loglevel 3

Paramin {#chap-paramin}
=======

This chapter describes how to run Gadget with paramin which runs the
optimisation routines in parallel across a network of processors which
will result in a much faster optimisation run. The current version of
paramin is implemented with MPI, Message Passing Interface, which
handles all the message passing between the master process, paramin, and
the slave processes, which are Gadget simulation runs. The setup is very
similar to a normal Gadget run, with all the Gadget input files are the
same, it's only the optimisation execution that differs.

Installation {#sec-paramininstall}
------------

In order to begin one must first download and install a version of MPI.
This version of paramin is made with an implementation of MPI-2 called
OPEN-MPI, one can download the MPI library and a wrapper compiler called
mpic++ from their website www.open-mpi.org. Now before trying to run
paramin make sure you have the newest version of Gadget downloaded. Now
open the Makefile with a text-editor and uncomment the section referring
to a Gadget Network version and comment out the lines which refer to an
install without MPI. Now you should open a console window and navigate
to the folder where you saved Gadget. Now you can simply type make in
the console and the program should be compiled and you get an
executable, let's assume it's called gadget-PARA. Now paramin is
dependent on some Gadget objects, so you now need to type the following
in the console:


    make libgadgetinput.a

Now you are ready to start compiling paramin. Download the newest
version of paramin and open the paramin folder in the console. You need
to edit the Makefile and add the path to the directory where you
installed Gadget as described above. Now you can run the make command to
compile paramin and get an executable, let's assume it's called paramin.

Running paramin {#sec-runparamin}
---------------

To be able to run paramin it's ideal to add the path of the two
executables, gadget-PARA and paramin to the global variable PATH. If
you're running a bash console you can edit the `.bashrc` to add it, you
can also copy the executables to the directory of PATH, but you probably
need root access to do that. Now you can call the functions from the
console. Here is an example of a typical paramin run:


    mpirun paramin -i <filename> -opt <filename> -network <filename> 
        -o <filename> -function gadget-PARA -s -n -i <filename> > <filename>

Now because paramin is implemented with MPI we need to call mpirun when
we run it. Now there are several files we need to call and a few
switches we need. The `-i <filename>` switch tells paramin which file
holds the parameters and their initial values, this file is the same as
the params.in file used in Gadget (see Parameter Files,
chapter \@ref(chap-param),
for more information on the format of this file). The `-i` switch with
the same `<filename>` has to be on Gadget as well.

Next we need to specify the optimization parameters with the
`-opt <filename>` switch, the preceding file contains the information of
which type of optimization run to perform for more information see
Parameter Files, chapter \@ref(chap-param), it's the same format as the optimization file
for Gadget.

The next switch tells paramin how many subprocesses paramin will spawn,
this switch is not in Gadget. Note that having at least 8 subprocesses
will greatly improve the time of the run, but there is no need to let
the number of subprocesses exceed the number of parameters, optimally it
should be best to have as many subprocesses as the number of parameters,
but then one should have access to at least that many processing cores.
A sample file which tells paramin to spawn 30 subprocesses looks like
this:


    ;
    ;Sample network file
    ;
    numproc    30

The `-o <filename>` switch specifies which file to output the optimized
parameters. This file will also contain information about the
optimization run, how much overall time was taken and how much time was
taken for each optimizing algorithm. The format of this outputted file
is the same as the one used as input, so the output can be used as a
starting point for later runs.

The `-function gadget-PARA` -switch tells paramin the name of the
executable it will spawn as it's subprocess, in this case it's the
gadget-PARA executable we made earlier. The user can also make his own
function to optimize with paramin. Now Gadget also needs parameters, we
pass to it the `-s` and `-n` switch to make it go to network mode, then
Gadget knows it's running with paramin. Finally we can add
`> <filename>` to specify a file for the output of the run, this is not
necessary but recommended.

### Additional information

If you're running a potentially very long run on a remote host it's
recommended to use the `screen` utility, for more information type
`man screen` in the console. It allows you to detach the session so it
lives after you log out of your SSH session. In short you can type
`screen` at the console to open a new screen session. Now run the script
or program you want to run and type `ctrl-a d`, and you detach the
session. Now you can safely exit from the remote host. To retrieve your
session on your next login simply type `screen -r` and you enter the
screen session, then you can close it by typing `exit` in the console.
Another option is to run the desired command with the `nohup` prefix, it
makes the command immune to hangups.

As stated earlier paramin can be used to optimize almost any function
which can be defined within the C++ language. The Rosenbrock function is
often used to test nonlinear optimization algorithms because it's quite
challenging for methods which do not rely on the gradient of the
function. A sample rosenbrock function and instruction on how to compile
and run it should be available on the MRI website under paramin. This
function can be used as a template for the optimization of any function
definable in the C++ language, future work will be to add a parser and
an R interface, so paramin can be called from within an R session using
an R defined function.

Paramin was originally written with PVM, but since PVM is no longer
supported it was migrated to MPI. More information on the migration
process from PVM to MPI can be found on the MRI website, there one can
also find study on the improvement in time relative to the number of
processes spawned for each optimization routine.

### Running paramin on multiple hosts/cluster

As stated above when we run paramin in the console it has to be invoked
with the `mpirun` command. The `mpirun` command can take some optional
arguments. First of all it can take the argument `-np <numproc>` where
numproc is the desired number of processes one wants to start. This
argument is **not** necessary with paramin because we define the number
of subprocesses in the network file and paramin spawns them dynamically.
The next optional argument we will discuss is the
$-\end{equation}-$`hostfile <filename>`. `<filename>` is a name of a file which
holds the name of the hosts in the cluster and how many processors are
available on each node. The authentication in the execution process is
done via ssh, so public keys have to be shared to allow for remote login
and execution between hosts. The programs desired to run in parallel
have to be installed on each host for this to work. For more information
see the FAQ entries on the OPEN-MPI webpage, there are more things that
need to be taken into consideration. Here is an example hostfile from
the open-mpi FAQ:


    # This is an example hostfile.  Comments begin with #
    #
    # The following node is a single processor machine:
    comp1

    # The following node is a dual-processor machine:
    comp2.dualcore slots=2

    # The following node is a quad-processor machine, and we absolutely
    # want to disallow over-subscribing it:
    comp3.quadcore slots=4 max-slots=4

Order of Calculations {#chap-order}
=====================

It is important to understand the order that Gadget performs the
calculations, since this could have an effect on the way the user might
structure the model. For each timestep of the simulation, the order of
the calculations is:

1.  **printing**. *Optional* printing of the model information at the
    beginning of the timestep, before any calculations have taken place
    for this timestep. Note that the default printing takes places
    towards the end of the timestep.

2.  **migration**. Move the stocks around between the areas in the
    model, using migration matrices as described in
    section \@ref(sec-stockmigrate).

3.  **consumption**. Calculate the predation by, and consumption of, the
    stocks in the model. Since a predator can consume more than one
    prey, and a prey can be consumed by more than one predator, the
    consumption calculations take place in 4 stages:

    1.  calculate the amount that each predator wants to consume of each
        prey, assuming that there is enough prey to meet these demands.

    2.  check that each prey is not "over consumed", to ensure that no
        more than 95% of the available prey biomass is consumed on a
        single timestep.

    3.  adjust the consumption of the predators to avoid overconsumption
        of the preys.

    4.  reduce the population of the preys according to the adjusted
        amount that the predators consumed.

    Note that the consumption calculations include the "consumption" of
    the stocks by any fleets in the model.

4.  **natural mortality**. Reduce the population of the stocks in the
    model by removing a proportion due to natural mortality (see section
    \@ref(sec-stocknatmort)).

5.  **growth**. Calculate any increase in length and weight of the
    stocks (see section \@ref(sec-stockgrowth)), and move any fish that will
    become mature (see section \@ref(sec-stockmature)) into temporary storage.

6.  **spawning**. Calculate the affect that spawning will have on the
    adult stocks, and place any spawned stock into temporary storage (see
    section \@ref(sec-stockspawn)).

7.  **maturation**. Add the newly matured fish (calculated as part of
    the growth update) into the model. Note that this comes after the
    mature fish have spawned, which means that a fish cannot become
    mature and spawn in the same timestep (see section \@ref(sec-stockmature)).

8.  **recruitment**. Add any new recruits to the model, including both
    the recruits specified directly (see section \@ref(sec-stockrenew)) and the
    recruits specified as part of the spawning process (see section
    \@ref(sec-stockspawn)). Note that this comes after the consumption
    calculations, so that new recruits cannot be consumed on the same timestep
    as they have been added into the model.

9.  **straying**. Move fish between stocks in the model that are
    straying, as described in
    section \@ref(sec-stockstray).

10. **likelihood comparison**. Calculate the likelihood score for each
    of the individual likelihood components. Note that most of the
    likelihood components use data that is based on the catch by a
    fleet, which has been calculated as part of the consumption process.

11. **printing**. Default printing of the model information at the end
    of the timestep, after the calculations have taken place for this
    timestep.

12. **ageing**. Increases the age of the fish in the model, optionally
    moving/transitioning the oldest fish to a different stock (see section
    \@ref(sec-stockmove)). This process takes place in 3 stages:

    1. If it's a transition step, set aside transitioning fish.

    2. If it's the stock's birthday (hard-coded to the final step of the
       year), then increase the age of all fish.

    3. Increase the age of any transitioning fish, and move into their new stocks.

Recent Changes {#chap-change}
==============

A version of this user guide was printed and published as a Marine
Research Institute report, available from the MRI, Reykjavik
(Hafrannsóknastofnunin Fjölrit nr. 120). That published version of the
user guide described the input file formats for Gadget version 2.1.00.
Since the publication of that report, a number of changes to the Gadget
software have been implemented, to fix any bugs that have been found and
to add new features. Some of these changes have resulted in small
changes to the format of the input files, and these user visible changes
are summarised below.

Gadget version 2.1.01 {#sec-v2101}
---------------------

-   removed the need to specify the lengths of the fleets (see
    section \@ref(chap-fleet)

-   added new suitability functions, the Richards suitability function
    and the Gamma suitability function (see
    section \@ref(sec-suitability))

-   added a fleet that uses catch in numbers data (see
    section \@ref(sec-numberfleet))

-   added an "energycontent" section for the preys (see
    section \@ref(sec-stockprey) and
    section \@ref(chap-other))

Gadget version 2.1.02 {#sec-v2102}
---------------------

-   simplified the format for the migration data (see
    section \@ref(sec-stockmigrate))

-   added prey preference parameters to allow for a Type III functional
    response when one stock is consuming another (see
    section \@ref(sec-consumption))

Gadget version 2.1.03 {#sec-v2103}
---------------------

-   changed the otherfood file format to specify the biomass of
    otherfood available, rather than the density of the otherfood (see
    section \@ref(sec-foodamounts))

-   added a fleet that extends the LinearFleet to take the different
    catchability of the various stocks into account (see
    section \@ref(sec-effortfleet))

-   added the StockPreyPrinter to the list of available printer classes
    (see section \@ref(#sec:stockpreyprinter))

-   added the PredatorPreyPrinter to the list of available printer
    classes (see section \@ref(sec-predatorpreyprinter)) to replace the old
    PredPreyStdAgePrinter and PredPreyStdLengthPrinter printer classes,
    which are no longer supported

Gadget version 2.1.04 {#sec-v2104}
---------------------

-   removed the need to specify the areas, predators or timesteps when
    calculating the score for the Understocking likelihood component
    (see section \@ref(sec-understocking))

Gadget version 2.1.05 {#sec-v2105}
---------------------

-   added a fleet that implements a simple harvest control rule (see
    section \@ref(sec-quotafleet))

-   added a survey index likelihood component that can use an index
    based on acoustic data (see
    section \@ref(subsec-sibyacoustic))

-   added a survey index likelihood component that can use an index
    based on effort data (see
    section \@ref(subsec-sibyeffort))

-   removed the need to specify the timesteps for the LikelihoodPrinter
    printer class, since the output is generated on the timesteps that
    the likelihood components have data for (see
    section \@ref(sec-likelihoodprinter))

-   changed the "half feeding value" format to specify the biomass of
    the prey, rather than the density of the prey (see
    section \@ref(sec-consumption))

Gadget version 2.1.06 {#sec-v2106}
---------------------

-   this version only contains bug fixes, so there are no changes to the
    format of the input files

Gadget version 2.2.00 {#sec-v2200}
---------------------

-   removed the hard-coded factor of 4 from various maturation and
    suitability functions (see equations
    \@ref(eq:l50suit),
    \@ref(eq:mat3)
    and \@ref(eq:mat4)) **note** that these functions have been
    re-named, so using one of these functions will currently generate an
    error to alert the user of this change

-   extended the options for a fleet that implements a harvest control
    rule (see section \@ref(sec-quotafleet))

-   added an option to aggregate the StockDistribution data (see
    section \@ref(sec-stockdist))

-   added the MigrationProportion likelihood component (see
    section \@ref(sec-migpro))

-   simplified the TimeVariable component (see
    section \@ref(subsec-timevar))

-   added the StockVariable component so some model parameters can be
    based on the biomass of a stock (see
    section \@ref(subsec-stockvar))

-   added a penalty to models with NaN values to ensure that the
    optimiser chooses a valid minimum value
