==== 2.3.7

Fixes issues with the use of bitwise boolean operators. 

==== 2.3.6

Updates allowing better compatibility with Windows line endings in Gadget input files.

==== 2.3.5

This package compiles & installs Gadget, a C++-based marine ecosystem modelling
framework. Whilst Gadget itself is a standalone executable, this is a first
step to releasing Rgadget[github.com/hafro/rgadget], an R front end that wraps
and extends core Gadget.

This is an update to attempt to fix build problems under Solaris:

In addition to the usual R-release & R-devel checks on Windows/Linux, the
Makefile now runs successfully on FreeBSD Make, to help flush out GNU-isms.
